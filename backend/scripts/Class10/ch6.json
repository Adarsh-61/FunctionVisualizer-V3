          "content": "### 1. Introduction: Scaling the World\nIn Class IX, we studied **Congruence**—the geometry of identical twins. Two figures are congruent if they have the *same shape* and the *same size*. You can superimpose one on the other perfectly.\n\nBut the real world is rarely about identical copies. It is about **Scaling**. \n* A photograph of the Taj Mahal is a small-scale model of the actual monument.\n* A map of India represents the country reduced by a constant factor.\n* An architect's blueprint represents a massive building on a sheet of paper.\n\nIn these cases, the *shape* remains the same, but the *size* changes. This concept is called **Similarity**.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definition\nTwo geometric figures are **Similar** if:\n1.  They have the same **shape**.\n2.  They do not necessarily have the same size.\n\n**Polygons:**\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar if:\n1.  Their **corresponding angles** are equal (Equiangular).\n2.  Their **corresponding sides** are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\n* **Example 1 (Equilateral Triangles):** All equilateral triangles are similar. Their angles are always $60^\\circ$. The ratio of sides will always be constant ($a_1/a_2$).\n* **Example 2 (Circles):** All circles are similar. They only differ by radius.\n* **Example 3 (Squares):** All squares are similar. Angles are $90^\\circ$, and side ratios are constant.\n\n**Non-Example:** Consider a Square and a Rectangle. Corresponding angles are equal ($90^\\circ$), but corresponding sides are not proportional (Square has 1:1 ratio, Rectangle has length:width ratio). They are not similar.\n**Non-Example:** Consider a Square and a Rhombus. Corresponding sides are proportional (1:1), but corresponding angles are different. They are not similar.\n\n**Conclusion:** For similarity of polygons, **BOTH** conditions (angle equality and side proportionality) must be met.",

Remember: Congruence is a special case of Similarity where the scaling factor is 1.\n\n#### 3.1 AAA Similarity Criterion (Angle-Angle-Angle)\n**Theorem 6.3:** If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (proportional) and hence the two triangles are similar.\n\n**Given:** $\\Delta ABC$ and $\\Delta DEF$ such that $\\angle A = \\angle D, \\angle B = \\angle E, \\angle C = \\angle F$.\n**Proof Strategy:** We \"cut\" the larger triangle to make a congruent copy of the smaller one on top, then use BPT.\n1.  Cut $DP = AB$ and $DQ = AC$ on sides $DE$ and $DF$.\n2.  $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta DPQ$ (SAS Congruence, as angles are equal and sides cut to be equal).\n3.  $\\angle ABC = \\angle DPQ$ (CPCT).\n4.  But $\\angle ABC = \\angle DEF$ (Given).\n5.  So $\\angle DPQ = \\angle DEF$. These are corresponding angles.\n6.  Therefore, $PQ || EF$.\n7.  By BPT on $\\Delta DEF$: $\\frac{DP}{DE} = \\frac{DQ}{DF}$.\n8.  Replace $DP, DQ$ with $AB, AC$: $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{AC}{DF}$.\n9.  Similarly, we can prove $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{BC}{EF}$. Hence Proved.\n\n**AA Similarity:** Since sum of angles is $180^\\circ$, if two angles are equal, the third *must* be equal. So, finding 2 pairs of equal angles is sufficient to prove similarity.\n\n#### 3.2 SSS Similarity Criterion (Side-Side-Side)\n**Theorem 6.4:** If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similar.\n**Statement:** If $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{BC}{EF} = \\frac{AC}{DF}$, then $\\Delta ABC \\sim \\Delta DEF$.\n**Proof:** Similar construction (cut $DP=AB, DQ=AC$) and use converse of BPT.\n\n#### 3.3 SAS Similarity Criterion\n**Theorem 6.5:** If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two triangles are similar.\n**Condition:** $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{AC}{DF}$ AND $\\angle A = \\angle D$.\n\n**Common Mistake:** Just like in congruence, the angle MUST be the **included** angle.

While you have used it since Class 7, Class 10 provides the **Formal Proof using Similarity**.\n\n#### Theorem 6.7 (Similarity in Right Triangles)\n**Statement:** If a perpendicular is drawn from the vertex of the right angle of a right triangle to the hypotenuse, then triangles on both sides of the perpendicular are similar to the whole triangle and to each other.\n* **Logic:** If $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$ and $AD \\perp BC$, then $\\Delta DBA \\sim \\Delta ABC$ (Common angle B, 90 deg angle) and $\\Delta DAC \\sim \\Delta ABC$.\n\n#### Theorem 6.8 (Pythagoras Theorem)\n**Statement:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n**Given:** $\\Delta ABC$ right-angled at $B$.\n**To Prove:** $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$.\n**Construction:** Draw $BD \\perp AC$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Triangle 1:** $\\Delta ADB \\sim \\Delta ABC$ (Theorem 6.7).\n    * Ratios: $\\frac{AD}{AB} = \\frac{AB}{AC}$.\n    * Cross-multiply: $AD \\cdot AC = AB^2$. --- (i)\n\n2.  **Triangle 2:** $\\Delta BDC \\sim \\Delta ABC$ (Theorem 6.7).\n    * Ratios: $\\frac{CD}{BC} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$.\n    * Cross-multiply: $CD \\cdot AC = BC^2$. --- (ii)\n\n3.  **Summation:**\n    * Add (i) and (ii): $AB^2 + BC^2 = (AD \\cdot AC) + (CD \\cdot AC)$.\n    * Factor out AC: $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC(AD + CD)$.\n    * From figure, $AD + CD = AC$.\n    * Therefore, $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC \\cdot AC = AC^2$. **Q.E.D.**\n\n#### Theorem 6.9 (Converse of Pythagoras)\n**Statement:** In a triangle, if the square of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the angle opposite the first side is a right angle.\n**Proof:** Construct a separate right triangle with legs equal to the given triangle's legs. Use Pythagoras on the constructed one, then SSS congruence to show the original is also right-angled.",
