These model situations where change is constant (e.g., buying items at a fixed price). However, nature and geometry often involve **products** of variables, leading to terms with degree 2.\n\n#### 1.1 The Necessity of Degree 2\nConsider this problem: *\"A charity trust wants to build a prayer hall with a carpet area of 300 sq m. The length must be one metre more than twice its breadth.\"* [cite: 1]\n\n* Let Breadth = $x$ metres.\n* Then Length = $(2x + 1)$ metres.\n* Area = Length $\\times$ Breadth = $(2x+1) \\cdot x$.\n* Equation: $2x^2 + x = 300 \\implies 2x^2 + x - 300 = 0$.\n\nThis is not a linear equation. It involves $x^2$. This is a **Quadratic Equation**.\n\n#### 1.2 Formal Definition\nA quadratic equation in the variable $x$ is an equation of the form:\n$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$\nwhere $a, b, c$ are real numbers and **$a \\neq 0$**.\n\n* **Standard Form:** Writing the equation in descending powers of $x$ (i.e., $x^2$ term, then $x$ term, then constant).\n* **Why $a \\neq 0$?** If $a=0$, the equation becomes $bx+c=0$, which is linear, not quadratic.\n\n#### 1.3 Roots vs Zeroes\n* **Polynomial Context:** For $p(x) = ax^2+bx+c$, the values of $x$ for which $p(x)=0$ are called **Zeroes**.\n* **Equation Context:** For $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are called **Roots**.\n* *Conceptually, they are the same thing.* Solving a quadratic equation is equivalent to finding the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial.\n\n#### 1.4 Historical Note\nQuadratic equations have been studied since antiquity. The Babylonians (c. 2000 BC) solved problems equivalent to quadratics. Euclid developed a geometric approach. Brahmagupta (AD 598–665) gave an explicit formula nearly identical to the modern one.

Solving by Breaking It Down\nFactorisation relies on a fundamental property of real numbers called the **Zero Product Property**.\n\n**Zero Product Property:** If $A \\cdot B = 0$, then either $A=0$ or $B=0$ (or both).\nThis allows us to break a degree-2 problem into two degree-1 problems.\n\n#### 2.1 Splitting the Middle Term (Logic)\nTo solve $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\nWe seek to express $bx$ as the sum of two terms $px + qx$ such that the factorization works by grouping.\n* **Condition 1:** $p + q = b$ (The sum is the middle coefficient).\n* **Condition 2:** $p \\times q = a \\times c$ (The product matches the product of outer coefficients).\n\n**Why does this work?**\nIf we write $ax^2 + px + qx + c$, we factor by grouping:\n$= x(ax + p) + \\dots$ wait, this is general. Let's look at the structure:\n$(mx + n)(rx + s) = mrx^2 + (ms+nr)x + ns$.\nHere $a=mr, b=ms+nr, c=ns$.\nProduct $ac = (mr)(ns) = mrns$.\nProduct of split parts of $b$: $(ms)(nr) = msnr$.\nThey are identical!

          "content": "### 3. The Geometric Origin of the Formula\nFactorisation fails when roots are irrational (e.g., $x^2 - 2 = 0$). We need a method to handle *any* quadratic. This method is **Completing the Square**.\n\n#### 3.1 The Intuition\nConsider $x^2 + 4x$. This is not a perfect square. A perfect square looks like $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$.\nComparing $x^2 + 4x$ with $x^2 + 2ax$, we see $2a = 4 \\implies a = 2$.\nTo make it a perfect square, we need to add $a^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\nSo, $x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x+2)^2$.\n\n**General Rule:** To complete the square for $x^2 + bx$, add $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$.\n\n#### 3.2 The Method Step-by-Step\nTo solve $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n1.  **Isolate constant:** $ax^2 + bx = -c$.\n2.  **Make leading coeff 1:** Divide by $a$: $x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x = -\\frac{c}{a}$.\n3.  **Complete the square:** Add $(\\frac{1}{2} \\text{coeff of } x)^2$ to both sides. i.e., add $(\\frac{b}{2a})^2$.\n4.  **Factor:** The LHS becomes $(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2$.\n5.  **Solve:** Take square root and rearrange.\n\n#### 3.3 Derivation of the Quadratic Formula\nLet's apply this method to the general form. This is one of the most important derivations in high school algebra.\n\n1.  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$\n2.  $x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x = -\\frac{c}{a}$ (Divide by $a$)\n3.  Add $(\\frac{b}{2a})^2$ to both sides:\n    $$x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + (\\frac{b}{2a})^2 = -\\frac{c}{a} + (\\frac{b}{2a})^2$$\n4.  Factor LHS and simplify RHS:\n    $$(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2 = -\\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$\n    $$(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2 = \\frac{-4ac + b^2}{4a^2}$$\n    $$(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2 = \\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$$\n5.  Take square roots:\n    $$x + \\frac{b}{2a} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$$\n    $$x + \\frac{b}{2a} = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n6.
