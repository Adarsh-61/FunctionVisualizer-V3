          "content": "### 1. Introduction: The Building Blocks of Shape\nGeometry is the study of shape, size, and relative position of figures. In Chapter 5, we established the axioms (rules) of Euclidean Geometry. Now, in Chapter 6, we begin applying these rules to the most fundamental elements of 2D space: **Lines** and **Angles**.\n\nEvery complex architectural structure, every triangular truss in a bridge, and every ray of light in optics can be analyzed using the concepts in this chapter. We are moving from \"looking at shapes\" to \"proving properties of shapes.\"\n\n#### 1.1 Basic Definitions (Recap & Refinement)\nBefore we argue about angles, we must agree on what our objects are.\n\n* **Line Segment:** A part of a line with two distinct end points. It has a definite length. Denoted as $\\overline{AB}$.\n* **Ray:** A part of a line with one end point (source) that extends indefinitely in the other direction. Denoted as $\\vec{AB}$. Examples: Sun rays, laser beams.\n* **Line:** A breadthless length that extends indefinitely in both directions. Denoted as $\\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.\n* **Collinear Points:** Three or more points that lie on the same straight line.\n* **Non-Collinear Points:** Points that do not lie on a single straight line (essential for forming triangles).\n\n#### 1.2 The Anatomy of an Angle\nAn **Angle** is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.\n* **Vertex:** The common end point (e.g., $O$).\n* **Arms (Sides):** The two rays forming the angle (e.g., $\\vec{OA}$ and $\\vec{OB}$).\n* **Measurement:** We measure the \"amount of rotation\" required to overlap one ray onto the other. The standard unit is **Degrees** ($^\\circ$), though advanced mathematics uses **Radians**.\n\n#### 1.3 Types of Angles (The Spectrum of Rotation)\nUnderstanding the magnitude allows us to classify angles:\n1.  **Acute Angle ($0^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$):** Sharp, narrow. Found in equilateral triangles.\n2.  **Right Angle ($x = 90^\\circ$):** The cornerstone of perpendicularity and trigonometry.\n3.  **Obtuse Angle ($90^\\circ < x < 180^\\circ$):** Wide, open.\n4.  **Straight Angle ($x = 180^\\circ$):** Looks like a straight line. The rays are opposite to each other.\n5.  **Reflex Angle ($180^\\circ < x < 360^\\circ$):** The \"outer\" angle. Often missed by students. Formula: $\\text{Reflex } \\angle A = 360^\\circ - \\angle A$.\n6.  **Complete Angle ($x = 360^\\circ$):** Full rotation.\n\n#### 1.4 Pairs of Angles: The Relationships\nGeometry becomes interesting when angles interact.\n\n* **Complementary Angles:** Two angles whose sum is $90^\\circ$. (e.g., $30^\\circ, 60^\\circ$).\n    * *Mnemonic:* \"C\" for Corner (Right Angle).\n* **Supplementary Angles:** Two angles whose sum is $180^\\circ$. (e.g., $110^\\circ, 70^\\circ$).\n    * *Mnemonic:* \"S\" for Straight (Straight Line).\n* **Adjacent Angles:** Two angles are adjacent if they have:\n    1.  A common vertex.\n    2.  A common arm.\n    3.  Their non-common arms are on different sides of the common arm.\n    * *Note:* Two angles can share a vertex and not be adjacent (e.g., vertically opposite).\n\n#### 1.5 The Linear Pair Axiom (Axiom 6.1 & 6.2)\nThis is a **fundamental truth** we accept without proof, which allows us to prove later theorems.\n\n* **Axiom 6.1:** If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is $180^\\circ$.\n* **Axiom 6.2 (Converse):** If the sum of two adjacent angles is $180^\\circ$, then the non-common arms of the angles form a line.\n\n* **Why is this crucial?** This axiom is our primary tool to prove a line is straight. If you calculate angles and find they sum to $180^\\circ$, you have proven collinearity.",

When Lines Meet\nThe intersection of two lines is the birthplace of the first rigorous proof in geometry.\n\n#### 2.1 Vertically Opposite Angles\nWhen two lines intersect, they form four angles. The angles opposite to each other at the vertex are called **Vertically Opposite Angles (VOA)**.\n* Intuition: If you take two scissors blades and open them, the angle between the top blades equals the angle between the handle blades. As one opens, the other opens identically.\n\n#### Theorem 6.1: VOA Equality\n**Statement:** If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal.\n\n**Given:** Two lines $AB$ and $CD$ intersect at point $O$.\n**To Prove:**\n1.  $\\angle AOC = \\angle BOD$\n2.  $\\angle AOD = \\angle BOC$\n\n**Proof (Step-by-Step Logic):**\n1.  **Identify Linear Pairs:**\n    Ray $OA$ stands on line $CD$.\n    Therefore, $\\angle AOC + \\angle AOD = 180^\\circ$ (Linear Pair Axiom). ---(i)\n\n2.  **Identify Another Linear Pair:**\n    Ray $OD$ stands on line $AB$.\n    Therefore, $\\angle AOD + \\angle BOD = 180^\\circ$ (Linear Pair Axiom). ---(ii)\n\n3.  **Equate:**\n    From (i) and (ii), both sums equal $180^\\circ$.\n    $\\angle AOC + \\angle AOD = \\angle AOD + \\angle BOD$\n\n4.  **Eliminate Common Term:**\n    Subtract $\\angle AOD$ from both sides (Euclid's Axiom: If equals are subtracted from equals, remainders are equal).\n    $\\angle AOC = \\angle BOD$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Similarly, we can prove $\\angle AOD = \\angle BOC$. Hence Proved.\n\n#### 2.2 Proof Writing Strategy\nNotice the structure above:\n1.  **Given/To Prove:** Sets the stage.\n2.  **Axiom Invocation:** We didn't invent logic; we used the Linear Pair Axiom.\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** We treated angles as variables.\n4.  **Conclusion:** We arrived at the truth definitively.\n\nThis method allows us to prove complex geometric truths by breaking them down into simple linear pair relationships.",

          "content": "### 3. The Geometry of Parallelism\nParallel lines are lines in a plane that never meet. But in geometry, we define them by their *angular properties* when cut by a third line.\n\n#### 3.1 The Transversal\nA line which intersects two or more lines at distinct points is called a **transversal**.\n\nWhen a transversal ($t$) cuts two lines ($m$ and $n$), 8 angles are formed:\n* **Exterior Angles:** $\\angle 1, \\angle 2, \\angle 7, \\angle 8$ (Outside the parallel zone).\n* **Interior Angles:** $\\angle 3, \\angle 4, \\angle 5, \\angle 6$ (Sandwiched between lines).\n\n#### 3.2 Angle Relationships (The Vocabulary)\n1.  **Corresponding Angles:** Angles in the same relative position at each intersection. (e.g., Top-Right $\\angle 1$ and Top-Right $\\angle 5$).\n2.  **Alternate Interior Angles:** Interior angles on opposite sides of the transversal. Form a \"Z\" shape. (e.g., $\\angle 4$ and $\\angle 6$).\n3.  **Alternate Exterior Angles:** Exterior angles on opposite sides. (e.g., $\\angle 1$ and $\\angle 7$).\n4.  **Interior Angles on the Same Side (Consecutive/Co-interior/Allied):** Form a \"C\" shape. (e.g., $\\angle 4$ and $\\angle 5$).\n\n#### 3.3 Axiom 6.3 & 6.4: Corresponding Angles\nThis is the bedrock of parallel line proofs. We cannot *prove* corresponding angles are equal; we *assume* it to define parallelism.\n\n* **Axiom 6.3 (Corresponding Angles Axiom):** If a transversal intersects two **parallel** lines, then each pair of corresponding angles is equal.\n* **Axiom 6.4 (Converse):** If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of corresponding angles is equal, then the two lines are parallel.\n\n#### 3.4 Theorem 6.2: Alternate Interior Angles\n**Statement:** If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Given:** $AB || CD$, transversal $t$ cuts them. Angles: $\\angle 1$ (exterior), $\\angle 3$ (interior) at top; $\\angle 5$ (interior) at bottom.\n2.  **Axiom:** $\\angle 1 = \\angle 5$ (Corresponding Angles Axiom).\n3.  **Theorem:** $\\angle 1 = \\angle 3$ (Vertically Opposite Angles).\n4.  **Logic:** From (2) and (3), $\\angle 3 = \\angle 5$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Alternate interior angles are equal.\n\n#### 3.5 Theorem 6.4: Co-interior Angles\n**Statement:** If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary ($180^\\circ$).\n**Proof Logic:**\n1.  Linear pair at top intersection gives $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 = 180^\\circ$.\n2.  Alternate angles gives $\\angle 4 = \\angle 6$.\n3.  Substitute: $\\angle 3 + \\angle 6 = 180^\\circ$?? No, careful with indices.\n    * Correct Logic: $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 = 180$ (Linear Pair). $\\angle 1 = \\angle 5$ (Corresponding). Thus $\\angle 5 + \\angle 2 = 180$.\n\n**Common Mistake:** Students often think Co-interior angles are *equal*. They are not. They sum to $180^\\circ$. \"C\" for Complementary? No, \"C\" for \"Common sum 180\".",

The parallel line theorems allow us to prove properties about triangle angles.\n\n#### 4.1 Theorem 6.7: Angle Sum Property\n**Statement:** The sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n**Intuition:** If you tear the three corners of a paper triangle and place them adjacent to each other, they form a straight line.\n\n**Proof (Rigorous):**\n1.  **Given:** Triangle $PQR$ with angles $\\angle 1, \\angle 2, \\angle 3$.\n2.  **Construction:** Draw a line $XPY$ parallel to base $QR$ passing through vertex $P$.\n3.  **Proof Logic:**\n    * $XPY || QR$. $PQ$ is a transversal. $\\angle 4$ (at XP) and $\\angle 2$ (at Q) are Alternate Interior Angles. So $\\angle 4 = \\angle 2$.\n    * $PR$ is a transversal. $\\angle 5$ (at YP) and $\\angle 3$ (at R) are Alternate Interior Angles. So $\\angle 5 = \\angle 3$.\n    * XPY is a straight line. So $\\angle 4 + \\angle 1 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$ (Angles on a line).\n    * Substitute $\\angle 4$ and $\\angle 5$: $\\angle 2 + \\angle 1 + \\angle 3 = 180^\\circ$.\n    * Rearrange: $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 + \\angle 3 = 180^\\circ$.\n\n#### 4.2 Theorem 6.8: Exterior Angle Property\n**Statement:** If a side of a triangle is produced, then the exterior angle so formed is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.\n**Proof:**\n* Let exterior angle be $\\angle 4$. Interior adjacent is $\\angle 3$. Interior opposites are $\\angle 1, \\angle 2$.\n* $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 = 180^\\circ$ (Linear Pair).\n* $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 + \\angle 3 = 180^\\circ$ (Angle Sum Property).\n* Equate: $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 = \\angle 1 + \\angle 2 + \\angle 3$.\n* Subtract $\\angle 3$: $\\angle 4 = \\angle 1 + \\angle 2$.\n\n**Key Insight:** This theorem implies that an exterior angle is strictly *greater* than either of the interior opposite angles. This is crucial for inequality proofs.",
