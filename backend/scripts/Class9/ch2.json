          "content": "### 1. Introduction: From Arithmetic to Algebra\nAlgebra is the generalization of arithmetic. While arithmetic deals with specific numbers, algebra deals with variables and generalized quantities. A **Polynomial** is one of the most fundamental structures in algebra, serving as a bridge between simple equations and complex calculus functions.\n\n#### 1.1 Variables and Constants\n* **Variable:** A symbol (usually a letter like $x, y, z$) that can take on various numerical values. It represents a quantity that can change.\n* **Constant:** A symbol (like $2, -5, \\pi$) that has a fixed numerical value. It represents a quantity that does not change.\n* **Algebraic Expression:** A combination of variables and constants connected by fundamental arithmetic operations ($+, -, \\times, \\div$). Examples: $2x + 3$, $\\sqrt{x}$, $1/x$.\n\n#### 1.2 Formal Definition of a Polynomial\nA polynomial in one variable $x$ is an algebraic expression of the form:\n$$p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$$\nwhere:\n* $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_0$ are constants called **coefficients**. These can be any real numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$).\n* $x$ is the **variable**.\n* The exponents $n, n-1, \\dots, 0$ must be **Whole Numbers** (non-negative integers: $0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n* $a_n \\neq 0$ (unless it is the zero polynomial).\n\n**Crucial Constraint:** An expression is **NOT** a polynomial if the variable $x$ has:\n1.  A negative exponent (e.g., $x^{-1} = 1/x$).\n2.  A fractional exponent (e.g., $x^{1/2} = \\sqrt{x}$).\n3.  An exponent that is irrational or complex.\n\n**Examples:**\n* $2x^2 + 3x - 5$: **Polynomial** (All exponents are whole numbers: 2, 1, 0).\n* $x + \\frac{1}{x}$: **Not a Polynomial** (Term $1/x = x^{-1}$ has a negative exponent).\n* $\\sqrt{x} + 2$: **Not a Polynomial** (Term $\\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$ has a fractional exponent).\n* $\\sqrt{2}x^2 + 5$: **Polynomial** (The coefficient $\\sqrt{2}$ can be irrational; only the exponent of $x$ matters).\n\n#### 1.3 Terminology\n* **Terms:** The parts of the polynomial separated by $+$ or $-$ signs. In $4x^2 - 3x + 7$, terms are $4x^2$, $-3x$, and $7$.\n* **Coefficients:** The numerical factor of each term. In $4x^2 - 3x + 7$, coefficient of $x^2$ is 4, of $x$ is -3, and constant term is 7.\n* **Constant Polynomial:** A polynomial containing only a constant term (e.g., $p(x) = 5$). Its degree is 0.\n* **Zero Polynomial:** The polynomial $p(x) = 0$. Its degree is **undefined**.\n\n#### 1.4 Classification by Terms\n* **Monomial:** A polynomial with exactly **one** term. (e.g., $2x, -5x^3, 7$).\n* **Binomial:** A polynomial with exactly **two** non-zero terms. (e.g., $x+1, x^2-5, 2x+3y$).\n* **Trinomial:** A polynomial with exactly **three** non-zero terms. (e.g., $x^2+x+1, 2x^3-5x+2$).\n\n#### 1.5 Degree of a Polynomial\nThe **degree** of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable present in the polynomial.\nLet $p(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots + a_0$ with $a_n \\neq 0$. Then $\\deg(p) = n$.\n\n**Classification by Degree:**\n1.  **Linear Polynomial ($\n = 1$):** General form $ax + b, a \\neq 0$. Graph is a straight line.\n2.  **Quadratic Polynomial ($n = 2$):** General form $ax^2 + bx + c, a \\neq 0$. Graph is a Parabola.\n3.  **Cubic Polynomial ($n = 3$):** General form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, a \\neq 0$.\n4.  **Biquadratic (Quartic) Polynomial ($n = 4$):** General form $ax^4 + \\dots$\n\n**Advanced Insight (BSc Level):** The set of all polynomials with coefficients in a field $\\mathbb{R}$ (denoted $\\mathbb{R}[x]$) forms a **Ring**. It has properties similar to integers (addition, multiplication, but not always division).",

The Remainder Theorem provides an elegant shortcut to find the remainder without performing long division.\n\n#### 3.1 Division Algorithm for Polynomials\nIf $p(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two polynomials such that $\\deg(p) \\ge \\deg(g)$ and $g(x) \\neq 0$, then we can find unique polynomials $q(x)$ (quotient) and $r(x)$ (remainder) such that:\n$$p(x) = g(x) \\cdot q(x) + r(x)$$\nwhere either $r(x) = 0$ or $\\deg(r) < \\deg(g)$.\n\n#### 3.2 The Remainder Theorem Statement\nLet $p(x)$ be any polynomial of degree $n \\ge 1$ and let $a$ be any real number. If $p(x)$ is divided by the linear polynomial $(x - a)$, then the remainder is $p(a)$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  By division algorithm: $p(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)$.\n2.  Since divisor is degree 1, remainder $r(x)$ must be degree 0 (constant) or zero. Let $r(x) = R$.\n3.  Substitute $x = a$ into the equation:\n    $$p(a) = (a - a)q(a) + R$$\n    $$p(a) = 0 \\cdot q(a) + R$$\n    $$p(a) = R$$\n4.  Thus, the remainder is $p(a)$.\n\n#### 3.3 Application\nInstead of dividing $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1$ by $x-1$ to find the remainder, we simply compute $p(1)$.\n$p(1) = 1 + 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 = 2$.

Substitute back $t = x+y$.\n\n#### 5.3 Cubic Identities\n6.  $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy(x + y)$ or $x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3$\n7.  $(x - y)^3 = x^3 - y^3 - 3xy(x - y)$ or $x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 - y^3$\n8.  $x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)$ (Sum of Cubes - Factorization form)\n9.  $x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)$ (Diff of Cubes - Factorization form)\n\n#### 5.4 The \"Mega\" Identity (Euler's Identity Context)\n10. $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)$\n    * **Alternative Form:** $\\frac{1}{2}(x+y+z)[(x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 + (z-x)^2]$\n    * **Conditional Identity:** If $x + y + z = 0$, then $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz$.
