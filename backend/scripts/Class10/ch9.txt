In this chapter, we step out of the abstract classroom into the real world. We use these ratios to measure the unmeasurable—the height of Mount Everest, the width of a river, or the distance of a ship from a lighthouse—without physically measuring them.\n\nThis branch of mathematics is historically known as **Heights and Distances**.\n\n#### 1.1 The Physics of Sight\nTo solve these problems, we must model how we \"see\" things mathematically. We assume light travels in straight lines.\n\n**1. Line of Sight:**\nImagine a ray of light traveling from the eye of an observer to the object being viewed. [cite_start]This straight line is called the **Line of Sight**[cite: 134].\n\n**2. Horizontal Level:**\nImagine a line drawn from the observer's eye parallel to the ground (earth's surface). This is the **Horizontal Level** or **Horizontal Line**. [cite_start]It serves as the baseline ($x$-axis) for measuring angles.\n\n#### 1.2 Angle of Elevation (Looking Up)\nWhen the object is *above* the horizontal level (e.g., looking at a kite or the top of a tower):\n* We have to raise our head.\n* The angle formed between the **Line of Sight** and the **Horizontal Level** is called the **Angle of Elevation** [cite: 134][cite_start].\n* *Mnemonic:* \"Elevation\" implies going up (like an elevator).\n\n#### 1.3 Angle of Depression (Looking Down)\nWhen the object is *below* the horizontal level (e.g., standing on a balcony looking at a car on the road):\n* We have to lower our head.\n* The angle formed between the **Line of Sight** and the **Horizontal Level** is called the **Angle of Depression**[cite: 135].\n* *Important Geometry:* Since the horizontal level at the eye is parallel to the ground, the Angle of Depression is numerically equal to the Angle of Elevation from the object back up to the observer (Alternate Interior Angles). This property is crucial for solving problems.\n\n#### 1.4 The Right Triangle Model\nEvery problem in this chapter reduces to constructing a right-angled triangle where:\n* **Vertical Side:** Represents the height (tower, building, cliff).\n* **Horizontal Side:** Represents the distance (ground, river width).\n* **Hypotenuse:** Represents the Line of Sight (ladder, string of kite).\n* **Angle:** The angle of elevation or depression.",

Single Triangle Problems\nThese involve a straightforward application of one ratio.\n\n#### Example 9.3.1: The Broken Tree\n**Problem:** A tree breaks due to a storm and the broken part bends so that the top of the tree touches the ground making an angle $30^\\circ$ with it. The distance between the foot of the tree to the point where the top touches the ground is 8 m. Find the height of the tree.\n\n**Solution Analysis:**\n1.  **Original Tree:** Let total height be $H$. The tree breaks at point $C$. The bottom part $BC$ remains vertical.\n2.  **Broken Part:** The top part $AC$ breaks and falls to form the hypotenuse $CD$. (Point $A$ touches ground at $D$).\n3.  **Components:** Height of tree = Vertical Part ($BC$) + Hypotenuse Part ($CD$).\n4.  **Triangle:** Right $\\Delta CBD$ at $B$. Angle at $D = 30^\\circ$. Base $BD = 8$ m.\n\n**Calculation:**\n* Find $BC$ (Opposite): $\\tan 30^\\circ = \\frac{BC}{BD} \\implies \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{BC}{8} \\implies BC = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$ m.\n* Find $CD$ (Hypotenuse): $\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{BD}{CD} \\implies \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{8}{CD} \\implies CD = \\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}}$ m.\n* Total Height: $BC + CD = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n* Rationalize: $\\frac{24\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 8\\sqrt{3}$ m.\n\n#### Example 9.3.2: The Kite\n**Problem:** A kite is flying at a height of 60 m above the ground.

Find the height of the tower.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.  **Diagram:** Let tower be $AB = h$. Let $C$ be the point for $60^\\circ$ and $D$ be the point for $30^\\circ$. $D$ is further away. So $D-C-B$ is the line order.\n2.  **Given:** $DC = 40$ m.

Find the height of the tower.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.  **Diagram:** Building $BC = 20$. Tower $AB = h$ on top of $BC$. Observer at $P$. Distance $PC = x$.\n2.  **Triangle 1 ($\\Delta BCP$, Bottom of tower):** Angle $45^\\circ$. Height 20.\n    * $\\tan 45^\\circ = 20/x \\implies 1 = 20/x \\implies x = 20$ m.\n3.  **Triangle 2 ($\\Delta ACP$, Top of tower):** Angle $60^\\circ$. Total Height $AC = 20 + h$.\n    * $\\tan 60^\\circ = (20+h)/x$.\n    * $\\sqrt{3} = (20+h)/20$.\n    * $20\\sqrt{3} = 20 + h$.\n    * $h = 20\\sqrt{3} - 20 = 20(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$ m.\n\n#### Type C: Elevation and Depression (From a Height)\n**Scenario:** Observer on top of a building looking at another object.\n\n**Example 9.4.3:**\nFrom the top of a 7 m high building, the angle of elevation of the top of a cable tower is $60^\\circ$ and the angle of depression of its foot is $45^\\circ$. Determine the height of the tower.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.  **Diagram:** Building $AB=7$. Tower $CD=H$. Observer at $A$. Draw horizontal line $AE$ from $A$ to tower $CD$.\n2.  **Depression Logic:** Angle of depression to foot $C$ is $45^\\circ$. So $\\angle ACE = 45^\\circ$ (Alternate Interior).\n3.  **Triangle 1 ($\\Delta AEC$):** In rectangle $ABCE$, $CE = AB = 7$. $AE = BC = x$. (Wait, typically $C$ is foot). Let's re-orient.\n    * Let Building be on left ($AB$). Tower on right ($CD$).\n    * Draw $AM \\perp CD$. $AM$ is horizontal.\n    * Depression to foot $C$ is $45^\\circ \\implies \\angle ACM = 45^\\circ$.\n    * In $\\Delta AMC$: $\\tan 45^\\circ = CM/AM$. Since $CM = AB = 7$, $AM = 7$.\n4.  **Triangle 2 ($\\Delta AMD$):** Elevation to top $D$ is $60^\\circ$. Base $AM = 7$.\n    * $\\tan 60^\\circ = DM/AM \\implies \\sqrt{3} = DM/7 \\implies DM = 7\\sqrt{3}$.\n5.  **Total Height:** $H = CM + DM = 7 + 7\\sqrt{3} = 7(1+\\sqrt{3})$ m.",

Its foot is pulled away from the wall through a distance $p$ so that its upper end slides a distance $q$ down the wall and then the ladder makes an angle $\\beta$ to the horizontal. Show that $\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{\\cos \\beta - \\cos \\alpha}{\\sin \\alpha - \\sin \\beta}$.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Formula & Concept Compendium\n\n#### 6.1 Definitions\n* **Line of Sight:** Line from eye to object.\n* **Angle of Elevation:** Angle above horizontal.\n* **Angle of Depression:** Angle below horizontal.\n\n#### 6.2 Key Properties\n* **Depression = Elevation:** The angle of depression from top to bottom equals the angle of elevation from bottom to top (Alternate Angles).\n* **Height Calculation:** $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\text{Distance}}$.\n* **Distance Calculation:** $\\text{Distance} = \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\tan \\theta} = \\text{Height} \\times \\cot \\theta$.\n\n#### 6.3 Standard Values used in Applications\n| Angle | $\\sin$ | $\\cos$ | $\\tan$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $30^\\circ$ | $1/2$ | $\\sqrt{3}/2$ | $1/\\sqrt{3}$ |\n| $45^\\circ$ | $1/\\sqrt{2}$ | $1/\\sqrt{2}$ | $1$ |\n| $60^\\circ$ | $\\sqrt{3}/2$ | $1/2$ | $\\sqrt{3}$ |\n\n#### 6.4 Common Surd Values\n* $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$\n* $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$",
