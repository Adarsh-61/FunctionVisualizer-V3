          "content": "### 1. From Plane Figures to Solid Shapes\nIn previous chapters, we dealt with **Plane Figures** like triangles, squares, and circles. These figures exist on a 2D plane; they have length and breadth, but no thickness. They have **Area** and **Perimeter**, but they cannot hold anything.\n\nNow, we step into the real world: the **3D World**. Objects here have length, breadth, and height (or thickness). These are called **Solids**.\n\n#### 1.1 Key Concepts\n1.  **Surface Area (SA):** The total area of all the faces (or surfaces) of the solid. It represents the amount of material (paper, cloth, paint) needed to cover the solid completely.\n    * **Unit:** Square units ($cm^2, m^2$).\n2.  **Volume (V):** The amount of space occupied by the solid. It represents the capacity of the solid to hold a substance (air, water, sand).\n    * **Unit:** Cubic units ($cm^3, m^3$).\n3.  **Lateral/Curved Surface Area (LSA/CSA):** The area of the side surfaces only, excluding the top and bottom bases. Useful for problems involving painting walls or making pipes.\n4.  **Total Surface Area (TSA):** The sum of the Lateral/Curved Surface Area and the area of the base(s).\n\n#### 1.2 The Dimension Logic\n* **1D:** Line (Length) $\\to$ Unit: $m$\n* **2D:** Plane (Length $\\times$ Breadth) $\\to$ Unit: $m^2$\n* **3D:** Solid (Length $\\times$ Breadth $\\times$ Height) $\\to$ Unit: $m^3$\n\n**Visualizing Capacity:** Imagine a hollow cube of side 1 cm. The amount of water it can hold is $1 ml$. Thus, $1 cm^3 = 1 ml$. This is the bridge between solid geometry and fluid capacity.",

Examples: Bricks, Matchboxes, Books.\n\n#### 2.1 Anatomy of a Cuboid\n* **Faces:** 6 Rectangles (Opposite faces are identical).\n* **Edges:** 12 Line segments where faces meet.\n* **Vertices:** 8 Corners where edges meet.\n* **Dimensions:** Length ($l$), Breadth ($b$), Height ($h$).\n\n#### 2.2 Deriving Surface Area\nImagine cutting a cardboard box along its edges and laying it flat. This is called the **Net** of the solid.\n* Top and Bottom faces: Area $= l \\times b$ (2 such faces).\n* Front and Back faces: Area $= l \\times h$ (2 such faces).\n* Left and Right faces: Area $= b \\times h$ (2 such faces).\n\n**Total Surface Area (TSA):** Sum of all 6 faces.\n$$TSA = 2(lb) + 2(bh) + 2(hl) = 2(lb + bh + hl)$$\n\n**Lateral Surface Area (LSA):** Area of the 4 walls (excluding top and bottom).\n$$LSA = 2(lh) + 2(bh) = 2h(l + b)$$\n*Note:* This is simply $\\text{Perimeter of Base} \\times \\text{Height}$.\n\n#### 2.3 Deriving Volume\nVolume is built by stacking area. If you take a rectangular sheet of area $l \\times b$ and stack $h$ such sheets on top of each other, you get a cuboid.\n$$\\text{Volume} = \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = (l \\times b) \\times h = lbh$$\n\n#### 2.4 The Cube: A Special Cuboid\nA **Cube** is a cuboid where length = breadth = height = $a$ (edge length).\n* **TSA:** $2(a\\cdot a + a\\cdot a + a\\cdot a) = 6a^2$\n* **LSA:** $4a^2$\n* **Volume:** $a \\cdot a \\cdot a = a^3$\n* **Diagonal:** The longest rod that can fit inside. $d = \\sqrt{l^2 + b^2 + h^2}$.
