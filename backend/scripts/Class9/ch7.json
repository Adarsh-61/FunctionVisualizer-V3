It is the only rigid polygon; unlike a square which can squish into a rhombus, a triangle cannot change its shape without breaking its sides. This rigidity is the foundation of engineering structures and geometric proofs.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definitions\n* **Triangle:** A closed plane figure formed by three intersecting lines. Defined by three non-collinear points $A, B, C$.\n* **Congruence ($\\cong$):** Two geometric figures are congruent if they have exactly the same shape and size. In Euclidean geometry, this means one can be superimposed on the other to cover it exactly.\n\n#### 1.2 Mathematical Congruence\nFor two triangles $\\Delta ABC$ and $\\Delta PQR$, congruence is not just equality of area. It is a **correspondence**.\n\nIf $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta PQR$, it implies six equalities:\n1.  **Sides:** $AB = PQ$, $BC = QR$, $AC = PR$\n2.  **Angles:** $\\angle A = \\angle P$, $\\angle B = \\angle Q$, $\\angle C = \\angle R$\n\n**CPCT (Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles):**\nThis is the \"Golden Hammer\" of geometry proofs. Once you prove two triangles are congruent, you can claim any corresponding pair of sides or angles are equal.\n\n* **Notation Warning:** Writing $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta QRP$ is **NOT** the same as $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta PQR$. The order of vertices dictates the correspondence. If $A \\leftrightarrow Q$, then $\\angle A = \\angle Q$, not $\\angle P$.",

We only need to check 3, provided they satisfy specific criteria.\n\n#### 2.1 Axiom 7.1: SAS Congruence (Side-Angle-Side)\n**Statement:** Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the **included angle** of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of the other triangle.\n\n* **Why is this an Axiom?** We cannot prove this using simpler concepts without assuming something about the nature of space (rigid motion). We accept this as a starting truth.\n* **The \"Included\" Condition:** The angle MUST be between the two sides. If we have Side-Side-Angle (SSA), congruence is **not** guaranteed (this is the \"Ambiguous Case\").\n\n#### 2.2 Theorem 7.1: ASA Congruence (Angle-Side-Angle)\n**Statement:** Two triangles are congruent if two angles and the **included side** of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of the other triangle.\n\n**Given:** $\\Delta ABC, \\Delta DEF$ with $\\angle B = \\angle E, \\angle C = \\angle F, BC = EF$.\n**To Prove:** $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta DEF$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Case 1 (Assumption):** Assume $AB = DE$.\n    * $AB = DE$ (Assumed)\n    * $\\angle B = \\angle E$ (Given)\n    * $BC = EF$ (Given)\n    * $\\therefore \\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta DEF$ (By SAS Axiom).\n\n2.  **Case 2 (Contradiction):** Assume $AB > DE$.\n    * Take point $P$ on $AB$ such that $PB = DE$.\n    * In $\\Delta PBC$ and $\\Delta DEF$:\n        * $PB = DE$ (Construction)\n        * $\\angle B = \\angle E$ (Given)\n        * $BC = EF$ (Given)\n    * $\\Delta PBC \\cong \\Delta DEF$ (SAS Axiom).\n    * $\\implies \\angle PCB = \\angle DFE$ (CPCT).\n    * But given $\\angle ACB = \\angle DFE$.\n    * So $\\angle PCB = \\angle ACB$.\n    * This is impossible unless $P$ coincides with $A$. Thus $AB = DE$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** In all cases, the triangles are congruent.\n\n#### 2.3 Corollary: AAS Congruence\n**Statement:** If any two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal, the triangles are congruent.\n**Logic:** If two angles are equal, the third is automatically equal (Angle Sum Property). Thus AAS reduces to ASA.",

We must *construct* an angle. We place the two triangles base-to-base and use the properties of the resulting quadrilateral (two isosceles triangles).\n**Proof:**\n1.  Given $\\Delta ABC, \\Delta PQR$ with equal sides.\n2.  Place $\\Delta PQR$ such that $QR$ coincides with $BC$ but $P$ falls on the opposite side of $A$, forming $P'$.\n3.  Join $A$ to $P'$.\n4.  Since $AB = BP'$ and $AC = CP'$, $\\Delta ABP'$ and $\\Delta ACP'$ are isosceles.\n5.  $\\angle BAP' = \\angle BP'A$ and $\\angle CAP' = \\angle CP'A$.\n6.

Extend $PQ$ to $S$ such that $QS = AB$. Join $S$ to $R$.\n2.  Prove $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta SQR$ (SAS).\n3.  This implies $AC = SR$ (CPCT).\n4.

Prove that the sum of the three altitudes of a triangle is less than the sum of its three sides.\n2.  Prove that the medians of a triangle are concurrent (intersect at one point).\n3.  If two sides of a triangle are unequal, prove that the median drawn to the third side makes a greater angle with the smaller side.\n4.  Show that in a right angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side.\n5.  Prove that the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than twice the median drawn to the third side.\n\n#### Section B: Must-Practice (Board/JEE Foundation)\n11. **(Must Practice)** In $\\Delta ABC$, if AD is the median and $AB + AC > 2AD$, prove it.\n12. **(Must Practice)** ABCD is a quadrilateral. Prove $AB + BC + CD + DA > AC + BD$.\n13. **(Must Practice)** Angles $B$ and $C$ of a triangle $ABC$ are equal. Perpendiculars from $B$ to $AC$ and $C$ to $AB$ are drawn. Prove they are equal.\n14. **(Must Practice)** If the bisector of an angle of a triangle also bisects the opposite side, prove that the triangle is isosceles.\n15. **(Must Practice)** Two sides $AB$ and $BC$ and median $AM$ of one triangle $ABC$ are respectively equal to sides $PQ$ and $QR$ and median $PN$ of $\\Delta PQR$. Prove $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta PQR$.\n16. **(Must Practice)** Prove that the difference between any two sides of a triangle is less than the third side.\n17. **(Must Practice)** In Fig, $PR > PQ$ and $PS$ bisects $\\angle QPR$. Prove that $\\angle PSR > \\angle PSQ$.\n18. **(Must Practice)** ABC is an isosceles triangle with $AB=AC$. Side $BA$ is produced to $D$ such that $AD=AB$. Prove that $\\angle BCD$ is a right angle.\n19. **(Must Practice)** Prove that a triangle must have at least two acute angles.\n20. **(Must Practice)** If two isosceles triangles have a common base, prove that the line joining their vertices bisects the base at right angles.\n\n---\n\n### 7.
