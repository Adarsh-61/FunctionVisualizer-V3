          "content": "### 1. Introduction: The Geometry of Curvature\nMost of the geometry you have studied so far—triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons—deals with straight lines. These are **linear** figures. The circle introduces a fundamental shift: **Curvature**. \n\nCalculating the boundary (perimeter) or the space occupied (area) by a curved figure requires a different mathematical toolset. This chapter bridges the gap between basic geometry and the powerful methods of calculus that you will encounter later.\n\n#### 1.1 The Circle: Definitions Revisited\nA **Circle** is the locus of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance from a fixed point.\n* **Centre ($O$):** The fixed point.\n* **Radius ($r$):** The fixed distance.\n* **Diameter ($d$):** The longest chord passing through the centre ($d = 2r$).\n\n#### 1.2 The Constant $\\pi$ (Pi)\nWhenever we measure the boundary of a circle (Circumference) and divide it by its diameter, we get a constant value, regardless of the size of the circle.\n$$\\frac{\\text{Circumference}}{\\text{Diameter}} = \\pi$$\n\n* **Nature of $\\pi$:** It is an **Irrational Number**. Its decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-recurring ($3.14159\\dots$).\n* **Approximations:** For practical calculations, we often use $\\frac{22}{7}$ or $3.14$. However, these are *not* the exact values of $\\pi$.\n* **Historical Context:** Aryabhata (AD 476–550) gave a very accurate approximation: $62832/20000 = 3.1416$. Srinivasa Ramanujan derived extremely efficient infinite series to calculate $\\pi$.\n\n#### 1.3 Circumference (Perimeter)\nThe distance covered by travelling once around a circle.\nFrom the definition of $\\pi$:\n$$C = \\pi \\times d = \\pi \\times (2r) = 2\\pi r$$\n\n#### 1.4 Area of a Circle: The Intuitive Proof\nWhy is the area $\\pi r^2$? We can visualize this without advanced calculus.\n1.  **Slicing:** Imagine cutting a circle into a large number of equal sectors (like pizza slices).\n2.  **Rearranging:** Arrange these sectors in a row, alternating pointing up and down.\n3.  **Resulting Shape:** As the number of sectors increases towards infinity, the shape resembles a **Rectangle**.\n    * The **Length** of this rectangle is half the circumference (since half the arcs are on top, half on bottom) = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\pi r = \\pi r$.\n    * The **Breadth** (or height) corresponds to the radius = $r$.\n4.  **Calculation:** Area of Rectangle = Length $\\times$ Breadth = $(\\pi r) \\times r = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThus, the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$.",

          "content": "### 2. Slicing the Circle: Sectors and Segments\nUsually, we don't deal with full circles, but parts of them. We must distinguish between two types of \"slices\".\n\n#### 2.1 Sector of a Circle\nA **Sector** is the region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc.\n* **Minor Sector:** The smaller slice (angle $\\theta < 180^\\circ$).\n* **Major Sector:** The larger slice (angle $360^\\circ - \\theta$).\n* **Central Angle ($\\\\theta$):** The angle subtended by the arc at the centre.\n\n**Deriving Area of Sector:**\nWe use the **Unitary Method** based on angles.\n* Area of the complete circle (angle $360^\\circ$) is $\\pi r^2$.\n* Area corresponding to $1^\\circ$ is $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{360}$.\n* Therefore, area corresponding to angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$A_{\\text{sector}} = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2$$\n\n**Deriving Length of Arc:**\nSimilarly, the total length of the circle is $2\\pi r$.\n* Length of arc corresponding to angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$L_{\\text{arc}} = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times 2\\pi r$$\n\n#### 2.2 Segment of a Circle\nA **Segment** is the region bounded by a **Chord** and the corresponding **Arc**.\n* **Minor Segment:** Enclosed by the chord and the minor arc.\n* **Major Segment:** Enclosed by the chord and the major arc.\n\n**Deriving Area of Segment:**\nThere is no direct formula for a segment based purely on $\\theta$ and $r$. We must decompose the figure.\n* Visualize the Sector containing the segment.\n* The Sector is composed of the **Segment** plus the **Triangle** formed by the two radii and the chord.\n* Therefore:\n$$\\text{Area of Segment} = \\text{Area of Sector} - \\text{Area of Triangle}$$\n$$A_{\\text{segment}} = \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2 \\right) - \\text{Area}(\\Delta OAB)$$\n\n#### 2.3 Area of Triangle $\\Delta OAB$\nFinding the area of the central triangle is the tricky part. We drop a perpendicular $OM$ to the chord $AB$.\n* Base of triangle = $AB$.\n* Height of triangle = $OM$.\n* Using trigonometry in $\\Delta OMA$ and $\\Delta OMB$:\n    * $AB = 2r \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    * $OM = r \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    * Area $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{2} (2r \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}) (r \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}) = r^2 \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\n    * Using the identity $\\sin \\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:\n    $$\\text{Area}(\\Delta OAB) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\sin \\theta$$\n    *(Note: For Class 10, calculating height and base manually for standard angles $60^\\circ, 90^\\circ$ is preferred over memorizing the sine formula directly, though the result is valid.)*\n\n**Special Cases:**\n* **$\\theta = 90^\\circ$:** Triangle is right-angled.
