          "content": "### 1. The Concept of Area\nBefore calculating area, we must define it. **Area** is the measure of the region enclosed by a plane figure. In Euclidean geometry, the fundamental unit of area is a square with side length 1 unit ($1 \\text{ unit}^2$).\n\n#### 1.1 The Standard Triangle Formula\nWe know from earlier classes that the area of a triangle is given by:\n$$\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}$$\n\n**Derivation of Standard Formula:**\n1.  Take a triangle $\\Delta ABC$.\n2.  Enclose it in a rectangle with length equal to the base ($b$) and width equal to the height ($h$).\n3.  The triangle occupies exactly half the area of the rectangle formed by the altitude and the base.\n4.  Since $\\text{Area}(\\text{Rectangle}) = b \\times h$, $\\text{Area}(\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{2}bh$.\n\n#### 1.2 The Limitation (The Altitude Problem)\nThis formula is powerful but has a significant practical weakness: **It requires the Altitude ($h$).**\n\n* **Scenario A (Right Triangle):** Easy. The legs are the base and height. Area = $\\frac{1}{2}ab$.\n* **Scenario B (Equilateral Triangle):** Manageable. We can derive height using Pythagoras ($h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$).\n* **Scenario C (General Scalene Triangle):** Difficult. Imagine you are a land surveyor measuring a triangular field. You can easily measure the three outer boundaries (sides $a, b, c$) with a tape measure. However, measuring the \"height\" requires walking into the field, finding the exact perpendicular drop from a vertex to the opposite side. This is physically difficult and mathematically imprecise without advanced tools.\n\n**The Question:** Is there a formula to calculate the area of a triangle using *only* the lengths of its three sides ($a, b, c$), without needing to know the altitude?",
