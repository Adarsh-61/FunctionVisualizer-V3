          "content": "### 1. From Unidimensional to Bidimensional Logic\nAlgebra is the study of structures and relations. In earlier classes, you mastered **Linear Equations in One Variable** (e.g., $x + 5 = 0$). These equations represent a single condition on a single quantity. Geometrically, their solution is a **single point** on a number line.\n\nHowever, the real world rarely operates on a single variable. Most phenomena depend on two or more changing quantities:\n* The cost of a taxi ride depends on *distance* and *time*.\n* The area of a rectangle depends on *length* and *width*.\n* The velocity of a projectile depends on *horizontal* and *vertical* components.\n\nTo model these relationships, we need **Linear Equations in Two Variables**.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definition\nA linear equation in two variables, say $x$ and $y$, is an algebraic equation that can be rearranged into the **General Form**:\n$$ax + by + c = 0$$\nwhere:\n1.  **Variables:** $x$ and $y$ are the variables (unknowns).\n2.  **Constants:** $a, b, c$ are real numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$).\n3.  **Non-Zero Condition:** $a$ and $b$ are not both zero. (Mathematically written as $a^2 + b^2 \\neq 0$).\n4.  **Linearity:** The exponent (power) of both variables is exactly 1. There are no terms like $x^2, y^3, xy, \\sqrt{x}, 1/y$.\n\n#### 1.2 Why \"Linear\"?\nThe term \"Linear\" comes from the Latin word *linearis*, pertaining to a line. \n* **Algebraic Reason:** The degree of the polynomial is 1.\n* **Geometric Reason:** When the solutions of such an equation are plotted on a Cartesian plane, they fundamentally and invariably form a **Straight Line**. (We will prove this relationship in Section 4.3).\n\n#### 1.3 Constraints and Degenerate Cases\nLet's analyze the condition $a^2 + b^2 \\neq 0$:\n* **Case 1: $a \\neq 0, b \\neq 0$:** This is a true two-variable equation (e.g., $2x + 3y = 5$). It represents an oblique line.\n* **Case 2: $a = 0, b \\neq 0$:** The equation becomes $0x + by + c = 0 \\implies by + c = 0 \\implies y = -c/b$. This is geometrically a horizontal line.\n* **Case 3: $a \\neq 0, b = 0$:** The equation becomes $ax + 0y + c = 0 \\implies ax + c = 0 \\implies x = -c/a$. This is geometrically a vertical line.\n* **Case 4: $a = 0, b = 0$ (Invalid):** The equation becomes $0 + 0 + c = 0$. If $c \\neq 0$, this is a contradiction (False). If $c = 0$, it is a tautology (True for all $x, y$). Neither represents a specific line.\n\n#### 1.4 Real-Life Modeling (The Art of Translation)\nMathematics is a language. Translating a word problem into an equation is a critical skill.\n* *Scenario:* \"The cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen.\"\n* *Translation:* Let cost of notebook = $x$, cost of pen = $y$. Relation: $x = 2y$ or $x - 2y = 0$.\n* *Scenario:* \"The sum of ages of two brothers is 20.\"\n* *Translation:* $x + y = 20$.",

          "content": "### 2. What is a \"Solution\"?\nFor an equation in one variable, say $2x - 4 = 0$, the solution is a single number $x = 2$. It is a specific value that satisfies the equality.\n\nFor two variables, a solution is not a single number, but a **pair** of numbers $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation simultaneously. \n\n#### 2.1 The Solution as an Ordered Pair\nA solution to $ax + by + c = 0$ is an ordered pair $(x_1, y_1)$ such that when $x$ is replaced by $x_1$ and $y$ by $y_1$, the LHS becomes equal to RHS (zero).\n\n* **Example:** Consider $x + y = 10$.\n    * $(5, 5)$ is a solution because $5 + 5 = 10$.\n    * $(1, 9)$ is a solution.\n    * $(-2, 12)$ is a solution.\n    * $(0.5, 9.5)$ is a solution.\n\n#### 2.2 Why Infinitely Many Solutions?\nThis is a fundamental concept often memorized but misunderstood.\n* **Algebraic Reason:** In the equation $ax + by + c = 0$, we have **two degrees of freedom** (two variables) but only **one constraint** (one equation). If we fix $x$, $y$ is automatically determined ($y = -(ax+c)/b$). Since we can choose *any* real value for $x$ (and there are infinite real numbers), there are infinite corresponding values for $y$.\n* **Geometric Reason:** The equation represents a line. A line is a collection of points. Since a line extends indefinitely and possesses the property of **continuum** (no gaps), it contains infinitely many points. Each point corresponds to a solution.\n\n#### 2.3 The Concept of Locus (Advanced)\nIn advanced mathematics, we view the equation as a **rule** or a **filter**. \nConsider the entire Cartesian plane (an infinite ocean of points). The equation $2x - y = 0$ acts as a filter. It asks every point $(x, y)$: *\"Is your ordinate exactly twice your abscissa?\"* \n* Point $(1, 2)$: \"Yes.\" -> You are on the line.\n* Point $(3, 5)$: \"No.\" -> You are not on the line.\nThe set of all points that say \"Yes\" forms the **Locus**, which happens to be a straight line.\n\n#### 2.4 Discrete vs Continuous Domains\nIdeally, $x$ and $y$ are real numbers (continuous line). However, context matters:\n* *Equation:* $x + y = 5$ where $x, y$ are **Natural Numbers**.\n    * Solutions: $(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)$.\n    * Total: Finite (4 solutions).\n* *Equation:* $x + y = 5$ where $x, y$ are **Real Numbers**.\n    * Solutions: Infinite (a continuous line segment between axes and beyond).",

For a linear equation, this graph is always a straight line.\n\n#### 3.1 Axiom of Line Determination\nFrom Euclidean geometry, we know that **two distinct points determine a unique line**. \nTherefore, to graph a linear equation, we theoretically need only two solutions. However, finding a third solution is recommended as a \"checkpoint\" to prevent calculation errors.\n\n#### 3.2 The Method of Intercepts (Most Efficient)\nThe fastest way to graph $ax + by + c = 0$ is often to find where the line cuts the axes.\n1.  **x-intercept:** Put $y = 0$ and solve for $x$. This gives point $A(x_1, 0)$.\n2.  **y-intercept:** Put $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. This gives point $B(0, y_1)$.\n3.  **Plot & Join:** Plot $A$ and $B$ and draw a line through them.\n\n#### 3.3 Lines Passing Through Origin\nIf the equation has **no constant term** (i.e., $c = 0$, like $y = 2x$), the line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$.\n* Here, putting $x=0$ gives $y=0$, and putting $y=0$ gives $x=0$. You get the same point twice.\n* You *must* pick a different value (e.g., $x=1$) to find a second point to determine the line.\n\n#### 3.4 Lines Parallel to Axes (One Variable Context)\n* **Equation $x = a$:**\n    * In one variable: A point $a$ on the number line.\n    * In two variables ($x + 0y = a$): A vertical line parallel to the y-axis, passing through $(a, 0)$. Every point on this line has abscissa $a$.\n* **Equation $y = b$:**\n    * In one variable: A point $b$ on the number line.\n    * In two variables ($0x + y = b$): A horizontal line parallel to the x-axis, passing through $(0, b)$. Every point on this line has ordinate $b$.\n\n#### 3.5 Reading the Graph (Slope Intuition)\nWhile formal slope ($m$) is taught later, observe the pattern:\n* Equation $y = x$: Line at $45^\\circ$.\n* Equation $y = 2x$: Line is steeper.\n* Equation $y = 0.5x$: Line is flatter.\n* Equation $y = -x$: Line slopes downwards.\nThis intuition connects the coefficient of $x$ to the steepness of the line.",
