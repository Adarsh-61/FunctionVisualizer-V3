          "content": "### 1. Introduction: Why Statistics Matters\nWe live in an information age. Every day, we encounter a barrage of numbers: the average temperature of the month, the strike rate of a cricket player, the inflation rate of the economy, or the polling numbers for an election. These numbers are not just random figures; they are **Data**.\n\nHowever, data in its raw form is often chaotic and meaningless. A list of the heights of 1,000 students is just a wall of numbers. To make sense of it, we need a method to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret this data. This mathematical science is called **Statistics**.\n\nIn Class 9, you learned to organize data into ungrouped frequency distributions and draw bar graphs. In Class 10, we step into the analytical phase. We move from asking \"What is the data?\" to asking \"What does the data represent?\" and \"Where is the center of the data?\"\n\n#### 1.1 Raw Data vs. Grouped Data\nTo understand the necessity of the methods we will learn, consider two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario A: Raw Data (Ungrouped)**\nA teacher asks 5 students for their marks out of 10: \n`5, 7, 9, 6, 8`.\nHere, the data points are few. We can easily see that the lowest is 5 and the highest is 9. We can calculate the average mentally.\n\n**Scenario B: Large Data**\nThe government wants to analyze the monthly income of 50,000 families in a city. A list of 50,000 numbers is useless to a human reader. To interpret this, we must **group** the data. We might say:\n* Families earning ₹10,000 – ₹20,000: 5,000 families\n* Families earning ₹20,000 – ₹30,000: 12,000 families\n\nThis process is called **discretization** or grouping. While grouping makes data manageable, it introduces a challenge: *We lose the exact values of individual observations.* We only know that a family earns between ₹10,000 and ₹20,000; we don't know if it's ₹10,001 or ₹19,999. \n\nThis chapter teaches us how to find accurate averages (Central Tendency) even when the exact individual data points are hidden inside groups.\n\n#### 1.2 Anatomy of a Frequency Distribution Table\nBefore calculating, we must understand the structure of the table we work with.\n\n1.  **Class Interval:** A range of values (e.g., 10 – 20). \n    * **Lower Class Limit ($l$):** The smallest value in the class (e.g., 10).\n    * **Upper Class Limit ($u$):** The largest value in the class (e.g., 20).\n    * **Class Size ($h$):** The difference between the upper and lower limits ($h = u - l$).\n\n2.  **Frequency ($f_i$):** The number of observations that fall within a specific class interval.\n\n3.  **Class Mark ($x_i$):** This is a crucial concept for calculation. Since we don't know the exact values inside a class (e.g., 10–20), we assume that the data is centered at the midpoint. \n    $$x_i = \\frac{\\text{Upper Limit} + \\text{Lower Limit}}{2}$$\n    We treat $x_i$ as the representative of the entire class.\n\n4.  **Continuous vs. Discontinuous Classes:**\n    * **Continuous (Exclusive):** 0–10, 10–20. The upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the next. (10 is included in 10–20, not 0–10).\n    * **Discontinuous (Inclusive):** 0–9, 10–19. There is a gap between 9 and 10. \n    * **Correction:** Most statistical formulas require continuous classes. If given discontinuous classes, we subtract 0.5 from the lower limit and add 0.5 to the upper limit to bridge the gap.",

          "title": "13.2 The Arithmetic Mean: Finding the Balance Point",
          "content": "### 2. The Mean ($\\\\bar{x}$)\nThe Mean is the most common measure of central tendency. It represents the \"center of gravity\" or the \"balance point\" of the data. If the total sum of all observations were distributed equally among all individuals, the value each would receive is the Mean.\n\nFor ungrouped data, Mean = $\\frac{\\sum x_i}{N}$.\nFor grouped data, we use the class marks ($x_i$) as representatives. However, calculating $\\sum f_i x_i$ can become computationally difficult if the numbers are large. Therefore, mathematicians developed three methods to calculate the mean. All three yield the **exact same result**; the difference lies only in the complexity of calculation.\n\n#### 2.1 Method 1: Direct Method\nThis is the definition of the weighted average.\n1.  Find the Class Mark ($x_i$) for each interval.\n2.  Multiply the frequency ($f_i$) by the class mark ($x_i$) to get $f_i x_i$.\n3.  Sum the products ($\\sum f_i x_i$).\n4.  Sum the frequencies ($\\sum f_i$).\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum f_i x_i}{\\sum f_i}$$\n\n* **When to use:** When the values of $x_i$ and $f_i$ are small, and multiplication is easy.\n* **Drawback:** If $x_i = 1452.5$ and $f_i = 25$, multiplication becomes prone to error.\n\n#### 2.2 Method 2: Assumed Mean Method\nTo handle large numbers, we shift the origin. We pick a central class mark and call it the **Assumed Mean ($a$)**. We then measure how far other values deviate from this anchor.\n\n1.  Choose a value $a$ from the $x_i$ column (usually the middle one).\n2.  Calculate the **Deviation** ($d_i$) for every row: $d_i = x_i - a$.\n3.  Multiply $f_i$ by $d_i$ to get $f_i d_i$.\n4.  Find the mean of deviations: $\\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum f_i d_i}{\\sum f_i}$.\n5.  Add the assumed mean back to get the true mean.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\bar{x} = a + \\frac{\\sum f_i d_i}{\\sum f_i}$$\n\n* **Logic:** If you subtract $a$ from every number, the average decreases by $a$. To fix it, we calculate the average of the remainders (deviations) and add $a$ back.\n\n#### 2.3 Method 3: Step-Deviation Method\nIf the deviations ($d_i$) are still large but share a common factor (usually the class size $h$), we can scale them down further. This involves changing both the origin and the scale.\n\n1.  Calculate $d_i = x_i - a$.\n2.  Divide $d_i$ by the class size $h$ to get $u_i = \\frac{x_i - a}{h}$.\n3.  Multiply $f_i$ by $u_i$.\n4.  The formula adjusts for both the subtraction of $a$ and the division by $h$.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\bar{x} = a + \\left( \\frac{\\sum f_i u_i}{\\sum f_i} \\right) \\times h$$\n\n* **When to use:** When class sizes are equal and the deviations are multiples of $h$. This makes calculations trivial (often single-digit numbers).\n\n#### 2.4 Interpretation of Mean\nThe mean is sensitive to **extreme values (outliers)**. \n* *Example:* If 5 people earn ₹100, and one person earns ₹1,000,000, the mean income will be huge, suggesting everyone is rich. This is a flaw of the mean. However, for relatively uniform data (like heights of students), the mean is the most accurate summary.",

In a voting system, the winner is the candidate who gets the *mode* of the votes.\n\n#### 3.1 Understanding Mode for Grouped Data\nIn ungrouped data (e.g., 2, 4, 2, 5, 2), the mode is simply 2 because it appears most often. \nHowever, in grouped data, we cannot see individual frequencies. We only see a class interval with the highest frequency. This interval is called the **Modal Class**.\n\n* **Conceptual Challenge:** Suppose the Modal Class is 20–30 with a frequency of 50. The mode is definitely inside this interval. But is it 21? 25? 29? \n* **The Logic of Interpolation:** The exact position of the mode inside the class depends on the \"pull\" of the neighboring frequencies.\n    * If the frequency of the *previous* class is high, the mode shifts towards the left (closer to 20).\n    * If the frequency of the *next* class is high, the mode shifts towards the right (closer to 30).\n\n#### 3.2 The Formula\nThe formula calculates this exact balance point within the modal class:\n\n$$ \\text{Mode} = l + \\left( \\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2} \\right) \\times h $$\n\nWhere:\n* $l$ = Lower limit of the **Modal Class** (the class with max frequency).\n* $h$ = Class size.\n* $f_1$ = Frequency of the **Modal Class**.\n* $f_0$ = Frequency of the class **preceding** (before) the modal class.\n* $f_2$ = Frequency of the class **succeeding** (after) the modal class.\n\n* **Interpretation of the term $(f_1 - f_0)$:** This measures how much the peak rises above the previous value.\n* **Interpretation of the denominator:** This normalizes the position based on both neighbors.\n\n#### 3.3 Important Note on Unimodal Data\nThis formula applies to data with a single distinct peak.

It divides the distribution into two equal halves: 50% of observations lie below the median, and 50% lie above it.\n\nUnlike the Mean, the Median is **Robust**. It is not easily influenced by outliers. If the richest person walks into a room of middle-class people, the Mean income skyrockets, but the Median income barely moves.\n\n#### 4.1 Concept: Cumulative Frequency (cf)\nTo find the \"middle\" person, we can't just look at individual buckets of data. We need a running total. \n* **Frequency ($f$):** How many in *this* group?\n* **Cumulative Frequency ($cf$):** How many in *this group and all previous groups*?\n\nThis tells us the **rank** or **position** of the data up to that point.\n\n#### 4.2 Locating the Median Class\n1.  Calculate the total number of observations, $N = \\sum f_i$.\n2.  Find the position of the middle item: $N/2$.\n3.  Look at the Cumulative Frequency ($cf$) column. Find the first class where $cf \\ge N/2$. This class contains the middle item.

We need to reach rank $N/2$.\n2.  We have already passed $cf$ items (from previous classes).\n3.  We still need to pass $(N/2 - cf)$ items.\n4.

For this, we use the Cumulative Frequency Curve, also known as the **Ogive** (pronounced 'oh-jive').\n\nThere are two types of Ogives, which tell the story of the data from opposite ends.\n\n#### 5.1 Less Than Ogive\nThis graph answers questions like: \"How many items are below value X?\"\n* **X-axis:** Use the **Upper Limits** of the class intervals.\n* **Y-axis:** Use the corresponding **Cumulative Frequencies**.\n* **Shape:** It is an increasing curve (rising upwards).\n* **Logic:** At the upper limit of a class (say 20), the cumulative frequency includes everything in that class and below. Hence, we plot (Upper Limit, cf).\n\n#### 5.2 More Than Ogive\nThis graph answers questions like: \"How many items are above value X?\"\n* **X-axis:** Use the **Lower Limits** of the class intervals.\n* **Y-axis:** Use the **Cumulative Frequencies** (accumulated from the bottom up, or Total - Previous cf).\n* **Shape:** It is a decreasing curve (falling downwards).\n* **Logic:** At the lower limit of the first class (say 0), *all* observations are \"more than or equal to\" 0. So we start at Total N and drop down.\n\n#### 5.3 Finding Median Graphically\nThe Ogive gives us a powerful geometric way to find the Median without calculation.\n\n**Method 1: Using One Ogive (Less Than)**\n1.

Connecting the Three Measures\nFor a perfectly symmetrical distribution (like a Bell Curve), the Mean, Median, and Mode are exactly the same point (the center peak). \n\nHowever, most real-world data is skewed (tilted to one side). In such cases, these three measures drift apart. Statisticians observed an approximate relationship between them for moderately skewed distributions:\n\n$$ 3 \\times \\text{Median} = \\text{Mode} + 2 \\times \\text{Mean} $$\n\n**Interpretation:** The Median always sits *between* the Mode and the Mean. The distance between the Mean and the Mode is roughly three times the distance between the Mean and the Median.\n\n**Utility:** This formula is incredibly useful when calculating one measure is difficult, but the other two are known. For example, finding the Mode from a histogram is easy, and Mean is standard. We can then estimate the Median quickly.",
