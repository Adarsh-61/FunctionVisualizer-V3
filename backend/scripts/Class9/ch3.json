          "content": "### 1. The Great Convergence\nMathematics, for centuries, was divided into two distinct pillars: **Geometry** (the study of shapes, sizes, and space) and **Algebra** (the study of equations, symbols, and quantities). For a long time, these two worlds existed in parallel but rarely intersected.\n\n* **Geometry** was visual and axiomatic, pioneered by Euclid.\n* **Algebra** was symbolic and computational, developed by Al-Khwarizmi and others.\n\nThis separation ended in the 17th century with the arrival of the French mathematician and philosopher **René Descartes** (1596–1650). Legend has it that while lying in bed and watching a fly crawl on the ceiling, Descartes realized he could describe the fly's position uniquely using two numbers: its distance from two adjacent walls.\n\n#### 1.1 The Fundamental Problem of Position\nImagine a blank sheet of paper with a single dot on it. How do you describe the position of this dot to someone who cannot see the paper?\n* Saying \"it's in the middle\" is vague.\n* Saying \"it's near the top left\" is imprecise.\n* To be exact, you need a **Reference System**.\n\nCoordinate Geometry (also called **Analytic Geometry**) answers this fundamental question: *\"How do we define position precisely using numbers?\"*\n\n#### 1.2 The Impact of Coordinate Geometry\nThis field is not just about drawing graphs. It is the foundation of:\n* **Calculus:** Describing curves like $y = x^2$.\n* **Physics:** Mapping trajectories of projectiles and planets.\n* **Computer Graphics:** Every pixel on your screen has coordinates $(x, y)$.\n* **GPS Technology:** Your location on Earth is defined by Latitude and Longitude (a spherical coordinate system).\n\nBy converting geometric figures into algebraic equations, Descartes gave us the power to prove geometric theorems using algebra and to visualize algebraic equations as geometric shapes. This chapter introduces the **Cartesian Coordinate System**, the tool that makes this all possible.",

          "content": "### 2. Constructing the Plane\nTo locate a point in a plane, we need two independent pieces of information. The Cartesian system provides this using two perpendicular number lines.\n\n#### 2.1 The Number Line (Review)\nRecall that a number line represents real numbers as points on a line.\n* There is a central point called **Zero (0)**.\n* Positive numbers are to the **Right**.\n* Negative numbers are to the **Left**.\n\n#### 2.2 The Cross: Axes and Origin\nTo create a 2D system, we take two number lines and cross them at their zeroes at a 90-degree angle.\n\n1.  **The X-Axis (Abscissa Axis):** The horizontal number line. \n    * Positive direction: Right ($OX$)\n    * Negative direction: Left ($OX'$)\n2.  **The Y-Axis (Ordinate Axis):** The vertical number line.\n    * Positive direction: Up ($OY$)\n    * Negative direction: Down ($OY'$)\n3.  **The Origin:** The point where the two lines intersect. This is the reference point for all measurements. Its value is zero on both lines.\n\n#### 2.3 The Plane\nThe flat surface containing these axes is called the **Cartesian Plane**, the **Coordinate Plane**, or the **XY-Plane**.\n\n#### 2.4 Quadrants: Dividing the Space\nThe two axes divide the infinite plane into four distinct regions called **Quadrants**. They are numbered counter-clockwise, starting from the top-right.\n\n* **Quadrant I:** Top Right. Bounded by positive x-axis and positive y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(+, +)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Right (positive) and Up (positive).\n\n* **Quadrant II:** Top Left. Bounded by negative x-axis and positive y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(-, +)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Left (negative) and Up (positive).\n\n* **Quadrant III:** Bottom Left. Bounded by negative x-axis and negative y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(-, -)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Left (negative) and Down (negative).\n\n* **Quadrant IV:** Bottom Right. Bounded by positive x-axis and negative y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(+, -)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Right (positive) and Down (negative).\n\n**Critical Note:** Points lying *on* the axes do not belong to any quadrant.",

Defining Position Precisely\nEvery point $P$ in the Cartesian plane is associated with a unique pair of numbers called its **coordinates**.\n\n#### 3.1 Ordered Pairs\nThe coordinates are written as $(x, y)$. This is called an **Ordered Pair** because the order matters.\n* $(2, 3)$ is NOT the same as $(3, 2)$.\n* In $(2, 3)$, we move 2 units right, then 3 units up.\n* In $(3, 2)$, we move 3 units right, then 2 units up.\n\n#### 3.2 Abscissa (x-coordinate)\n* **Definition:** The first number in the pair.\n* **Geometric Meaning:** The perpendicular distance of the point from the **y-axis**.\n    * (Careful: x-coordinate tells you distance from y-axis).\n* **Direction:** Measured along the x-axis (Right/Left).\n* **Notation:** Often denoted by $x$.\n\n#### 3.3 Ordinate (y-coordinate)\n* **Definition:** The second number in the pair.\n* **Geometric Meaning:** The perpendicular distance of the point from the **x-axis**.\n    * (Careful: y-coordinate tells you distance from x-axis).\n* **Direction:** Measured along the y-axis (Up/Down).\n* **Notation:** Often denoted by $y$.\n\n#### 3.4 Coordinates of Special Points\n1.  **The Origin:** The intersection of axes. It is 0 units from y-axis and 0 units from x-axis. Coordinates: $(0, 0)$.\n2.  **Point on X-Axis:** Any point on the x-axis has zero vertical distance. Its ordinate is always 0. General form: $(x, 0)$.\n3.  **Point on Y-Axis:** Any point on the y-axis has zero horizontal distance. Its abscissa is always 0. General form: $(0, y)$.\n\n#### 3.5 Formal Mapping\nThere is a **one-to-one correspondence** (Bijective mapping) between the set of all points in the plane and the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n* For every point, there is a unique pair $(x, y)$.\n* For every pair $(x, y)$, there is a unique point.\n\n#### 3.6 Perpendicular Distance vs Coordinates\nThis is a common source of confusion.\n* Coordinates can be negative: $P(-3, -4)$.\n* Distance is always non-negative.\n    * Distance of $P(-3, -4)$ from y-axis is $|-3| = 3$ units.\n    * Distance of $P(-3, -4)$ from x-axis is $|-4| = 4$ units.",

The Art of Plotting\nPlotting a point means marking its exact location on the Cartesian plane given its coordinates.\n\n#### 4.1 Methodology\nTo plot a point $P(a, b)$:\n1.  Start at the **Origin** $(0, 0)$.\n2.  **Move Horizontally:** Look at $a$.\n    * If $a > 0$, move $a$ units to the **Right** along the x-axis.\n    * If $a < 0$, move $|a|$ units to the **Left** along the x-axis.\n    * If $a = 0$, stay at the origin horizontally.\n3.  **Move Vertically:** From your new position on the x-axis, look at $b$.\n    * If $b > 0$, move $b$ units **Up** parallel to the y-axis.\n    * If $b < 0$, move $|b|$ units **Down** parallel to the y-axis.\n    * If $b = 0$, stay on the x-axis.\n4.  **Mark the Point:** Draw a dot and label it $P(a, b)$.\n\n#### 4.2 Visualizing Reflection (Symmetry)\nPlotting teaches us about symmetry:\n* Points $(x, y)$ and $(x, -y)$ are mirror images across the **x-axis**.\n* Points $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$ are mirror images across the **y-axis**.\n* Points $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ are symmetric about the **Origin**.\n\n#### 4.3 Why Order Matters (Example)\nLet's plot $A(3, 1)$ and $B(1, 3)$.\n* For $A(3, 1)$: Move 3 Right, 1 Up.\n* For $B(1, 3)$: Move 1 Right, 3 Up.\n* Clearly, these are two different positions in the plane.

The area of the triangle formed by them is **zero**. This concept helps in testing collinearity.\n\n#### 5.3 Locus (The Path of a Point)\nA key concept in advanced geometry is **Locus**: The set of all points satisfying a specific condition.\n* **Example:** What is the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that $x = 3$?\n    * It is a vertical line passing through 3 on the x-axis. Every point on this line has abscissa 3 (e.g., $(3, 0), (3, 5), (3, -100)$).\n* **Example:** What is the set of all points such that $y = x$?\n    * It is a line passing through the origin at 45 degrees. Every point has equal abscissa and ordinate (e.g., $(1, 1), (-5, -5)$).\n\n#### 5.4 Line Equations (Preview)\nA linear equation $ax + by + c = 0$ represents a straight line in the Cartesian plane.
