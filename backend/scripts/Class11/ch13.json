      "content": "### 1. The Limitation of Averages\nIn earlier classes, we learned about **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean ($\\bar{x}$), Median ($M$), and Mode ($Z$). These give us a single value that represents the entire data set. However, an average alone can be misleading.\n\n**Consider this example:**\nTwo cricketers, Player A and Player B, have the following scores in 5 matches:\n* **Player A:** 48, 50, 53, 49, 50. (Mean = 50)\n* **Player B:** 0, 0, 100, 100, 50. (Mean = 50)\n\nBoth have the same mean score of 50. However, Player A is consistent, while Player B is volatile (unreliable). The mean fails to capture this **variability** or **spread**.\n\n### 2. Dispersion\nTo understand data fully, we need to know how 'scattered' the data points are around the average. This property is called **Dispersion**.\n\n**Measures of Dispersion:**\n1.  **Range:** The simplest measure (Max - Min).\n2.  **Quartile Deviation:** Based on the middle 50% of data.\n3.  **Mean Deviation:** The average of absolute differences from the center.\n4.  **Standard Deviation (and Variance):** The most mathematically robust measure, based on squared differences.\n\n### 3. Range\n$$ \\text{Range} = \\text{Maximum Value} - \\text{Minimum Value} $$\n* *Pros:* Easy to calculate.\n* *Cons:* Very sensitive to outliers. It ignores the pattern of distribution between the extremes.",

      "content": "### 1. The Logic of Mean Deviation\nWe want to calculate the average distance of all data points from a central value (Mean $\\bar{x}$ or Median $M$).\nIf we simply take the sum of deviations $\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})$, the result is always **zero** because positive and negative deviations cancel each other out. \n\nTo fix this, we take the **absolute value** (modulus) of the deviations.\n\n### 2. Mean Deviation for Ungrouped Data\nFor $n$ observations $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$:\n\n**A. About Mean ($\\bar{x}$):**\n$$ M.D.(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - \\bar{x}|}{n} $$\n\n**B. About Median ($M$):**\n$$ M.D.(M) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - M|}{n} $$\n\n### 3. Mean Deviation for Grouped Data\n\n**A. Discrete Frequency Distribution:**\nIf data points $x_i$ occur with frequencies $f_i$:\n$$ M.D.(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i |x_i - \\bar{x}|}{N} $$\nwhere $N = \\sum f_i$.\n\n**B. Continuous Frequency Distribution:**\n1.  Find the midpoint ($x_i$) of each class interval.\n2.  Calculate Mean $\\bar{x}$ or Median $M$ using standard formulas.\n3.  Apply the formula: $M.D. = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum f_i |x_i - A|$ (where $A$ is mean/median).\n\n### 4. Key Property\nThe Mean Deviation is **minimum** when measured from the **Median**. This makes the median the central point that minimizes the total absolute error.",

      "content": "### 1. Why Not Just Mean Deviation?\nWhile Mean Deviation is intuitive, the modulus function $|x|$ is not differentiable at 0 and is algebraically difficult to handle in higher mathematics. To avoid negative signs without using modulus, we **square** the deviations.\n\n### 2. Variance ($\\sigma^2$)\nThe mean of the squares of the deviations from the mean is called **Variance**.\n\n**Formula (Ungrouped Data):**\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 $$\n\n**Alternate Computational Formula:**\nExpanding $(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$ allows for faster calculation:\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum x_i^2 - \\left( \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} \\right)^2 $$\n*(Mean of Squares minus Square of Mean)*\n\n### 3. Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)\nVariance has units that are the square of the original data (e.g., $cm^2$ vs $cm$). To bring the measure back to the original scale, we take the positive square root.\n\n$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\text{Variance}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\n\n### 4. For Discrete Frequency Distribution\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 $$\nOR\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum f_i x_i^2 - \\left( \\frac{\\sum f_i x_i}{N} \\right)^2 $$\n\n### 5. Step-Deviation Method (Continuous Data)\nWhen values of $x_i$ are large, we use the transformation $y_i = \\frac{x_i - A}{h}$.\n\n$$ \\sigma_x = h \\cdot \\sigma_y $$\n$$ \\sigma_x = h \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum f_i y_i^2 - \\left( \\frac{\\sum f_i y_i}{N} \\right)^2 } $$\n\n**Note:** Variance is independent of the change of origin but depends on the scale.
