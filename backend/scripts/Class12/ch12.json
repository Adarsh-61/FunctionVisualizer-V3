      "content": "### 1. The Optimization Problem\nIn business, engineering, and military operations, we often need to make decisions to maximize efficiency (like profit, speed, or output) or minimize waste (like cost, time, or risk), while adhering to specific limitations (budget, capacity, resources). These are called **Optimization Problems**.\n\n**Linear Programming (LP)** is a specific class of optimization problems where:\n1.  The function to be optimized is linear.\n2.  The constraints are linear inequalities.\n\n### 2. Key Terminology\nConsider a furniture dealer who sells tables and chairs. He wants to maximize profit.\n\n1.  **Decision Variables:** The unknown quantities to be determined. usually denoted by $x, y$. (e.g., $x=$ number of tables, $y=$ number of chairs).\n2.  **Objective Function ($Z$):** A linear function $Z = ax + by$ which needs to be maximized or minimized. (e.g., Total Profit $Z = 500x + 150y$).\n3.  **Constraints:** The linear inequalities or equations (restrictions) on the variables. (e.g., Investment limit, Space limit).\n    * Format: $a_1x + b_1y \\le d_1$, etc.\n4.  **Non-negative Constraints:** In physical problems, variables cannot be negative. $x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0$.\n\n### 3. Mathematical Formulation of LPP\n**General Form:**\nMaximize (or Minimize) $Z = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \\dots + c_nx_n$\nSubject to constraints:\n$$ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + \\dots \\le b_1 $$\n$$ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + \\dots \\ge b_2 $$\n$$ \\dots $$\nand $x_1, x_2, \\dots \\ge 0$."

      "content": "Since the NCERT syllabus deals with two variables ($x, y$), we use the **Graphical Method**.\n\n### 1. The Feasible Region\nThe **Feasible Region** is the common region determined by all the constraints (inequalities) including non-negative constraints. Every point in this region represents a **Feasible Solution**.\n* Points outside represent **Infeasible Solutions**.\n\n### 2. Convexity of the Region\nThe feasible region of an LPP is always a **Convex Polygon** (in 2D). This means if you take any two points inside the region, the line segment joining them lies entirely inside the region.\n\n### 3. The Corner Point Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of LP)\nThis theorem gives us the strategy to find the optimal solution without checking infinite points.\n\n**Theorem 1:** Let $R$ be the feasible region (convex polygon) for an LPP and let $Z = ax + by$ be the objective function. When $Z$ has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), it **must occur at one of the corner points (vertices)** of the feasible region.\n\n**Theorem 2 (Existence):**\nLet $R$ be the feasible region.\n* If $R$ is **Bounded**, then the objective function $Z$ has both a Maximum and a Minimum value on $R$, and each occurs at a corner point.\n* If $R$ is **Unbounded**, then a Maximum or Minimum value **may or may not exist**. If it exists, it must occur at a corner point.\n\n### 4. Algorithm (Corner Point Method)\n1.  Formulate the LPP.\n2.  Draw the graph of constraints and identify the Feasible Region.\n3.  Determine the coordinates of the **Corner Points** (Vertices).\n4.  Evaluate $Z = ax + by$ at each corner point.\n5.  Identify the maximum/minimum value from this list.\n6.  **Unbounded Check:** (See next section)."

      "content": "If the feasible region is unbounded, the maximum or minimum value found at the corner points might not be the global extremum. We must verify.\n\n### 1. Verification Step for Unbounded Regions\nLet $M$ be the maximum value of $Z$ obtained at a corner point.\nTo verify if $M$ is truly the maximum:\n1.  Draw the inequality **$ax + by > M$**.\n2.  Check if the open half-plane determined by this inequality has **any point in common** with the feasible region.\n    * If **NO** common point: $M$ is the Maximum.\n    * If **YES** common point: The feasible region extends into values higher than $M$. Thus, **No Maximum exists**.\n\n*(Similarly for Minimum $m$: Check $ax + by < m$)*.\n\n### 2. Multiple Optimal Solutions\nIf two corner points give the same optimal value of $Z$, then **every point on the line segment joining these two points** is also an optimal solution.\nThis implies the LPP has infinitely many solutions."
