          "content": "### 1. From Planes to Space\nWe live in a three-dimensional world. While we draw on 2D paper, the objects we interact with—bottles, balls, boxes, buildings—are 3D solids. They occupy space and have surfaces.\n\nIn Class 9, you were introduced to basic solids. In Class 10, we move to **Composite Solids**—combinations of basic shapes. To solve these problems, you must first master the art of decomposition: breaking a complex object into simple parts.\n\n#### 1.1 Surface Area vs Volume\nThis distinction is crucial and often confused.\n1.  **Surface Area:** Imagine you want to **paint** the object or wrap it in **gift paper**. The amount of paint or paper required depends on the area of the boundaries (faces). It is a 2D measure of the \"skin\" of the object.\n    * **Unit:** Square units ($cm^2, m^2$).\n2.  **Volume:** Imagine you want to **fill** the object with water or sand. The amount it can hold (capacity) or the space it occupies is Volume. It is a 3D measure of the \"body\" of the object.\n    * **Unit:** Cubic units ($cm^3, m^3$).\n\n#### 1.2 Types of Surface Area\n* **Curved Surface Area (CSA):** Also called Lateral Surface Area. This is the area of the \"curved\" part only, excluding the flat top and bottom bases. Used for open pipes, tents, etc.\n* **Total Surface Area (TSA):** CSA + Area of Top Base + Area of Bottom Base. Used for closed containers, solid blocks, etc.",
