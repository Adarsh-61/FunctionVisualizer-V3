      "content": "### 1. Concept of Instantaneous Rate\nIn physics and geometry, quantities often change with respect to time or another variable. The derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of $y$ with respect to $x$.\n\n**Definition:**\nIf a quantity $y$ varies with another quantity $x$, satisfying $y = f(x)$, then $f'(x_0)$ or $\\frac{dy}{dx}|_{x=x_0}$ represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ at $x = x_0$.\n\n### 2. Related Rates (Chain Rule Application)\nOften, two variables $x$ and $y$ are related by an equation, and both change with respect to a third variable (usually time $t$).\nBy the Chain Rule:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\n\n**Common Scenarios:**\n1.  **Geometry:** Area ($A$) and Radius ($r$) of a circle. $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\pi r^2) = 2\\pi r \\frac{dr}{dt}$.\n2.  **Volume:** Volume ($V$) and Edge ($x$) of a cube. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(x^3) = 3x^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n3.  **Ladder Problems:** Relationship $x^2 + y^2 = L^2$. Differentiating w.r.t $t$: $2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.\n\n### 3. Marginal Cost and Revenue (Economics Application)\n* **Marginal Cost (MC):** The instantaneous rate of change of total cost ($C$) with respect to the number of items produced ($x$).\n    $$ MC = \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\n* **Marginal Revenue (MR):** The rate of change of total revenue ($R$) with respect to the number of items sold ($x$).\n    $$ MR = \\frac{dR}{dx} $$"

Critical Points and Intervals\nTo find intervals of monotonicity:\n1.  Find $f'(x)$.\n2.  Set $f'(x) = 0$ to find **Critical Points**.\n3.  Also include points where $f'(x)$ is undefined.\n4.  Plot these points on a number line to divide the domain into disjoint intervals.\n5.
