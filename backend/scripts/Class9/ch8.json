It generalizes the concept of a triangle (3 sides) to the next level of complexity.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definition\nLet $A, B, C, D$ be four points in a plane such that no three of them are collinear, and the line segments $AB, BC, CD,$ and $DA$ do not intersect except at their endpoints. The figure formed by these four segments is called the quadrilateral $ABCD$.\n\n* **Vertices:** The points $A, B, C, D$.\n* **Sides:** The segments $AB, BC, CD, DA$.\n* **Angles:** $\\angle A, \\angle B, \\angle C, \\angle D$.\n* **Diagonals:** The segments joining opposite vertices ($AC$ and $BD$).\n\n#### 1.2 The Angle Sum Property\nJust as the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.\n\n**Theorem 8.0:** The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.\n**Given:** A quadrilateral $ABCD$.\n**To Prove:** $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C + \\angle D = 360^\\circ$.\n**Construction:** Join diagonal $AC$. This divides the quadrilateral into two triangles, $\\Delta ABC$ and $\\Delta ADC$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  In $\\Delta ABC$: $\\angle CAB + \\angle B + \\angle BCA = 180^\\circ$ (Angle Sum Property of $\\Delta$). ---(i)\n2.  In $\\Delta ADC$: $\\angle DAC + \\angle D + \\angle ACD = 180^\\circ$. ---(ii)\n3.  Adding (i) and (ii):\n    $(\\angle CAB + \\angle DAC) + \\angle B + \\angle D + (\\angle BCA + \\angle ACD) = 180^\\circ + 180^\\circ$\n4.  From the figure, $\\angle CAB + \\angle DAC = \\angle A$ and $\\angle BCA + \\angle ACD = \\angle C$.\n5.  Therefore, $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C + \\angle D = 360^\\circ$.\n\n**Intuition:** Any $n$-sided polygon can be divided into $(n-2)$ triangles. For a quadrilateral ($n=4$), we have 2 triangles. $2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ$.",

Use **SSS** Congruence. Then corresponding angles equal $\\implies$ Alternate angles equal $\\implies$ Lines Parallel.\n* **Thm 8.5:** If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then it is a parallelogram.\n    * *Proof:* Use Angle Sum property ($2A + 2B = 360$) to show co-interior angles sum to 180.\n\n#### Theorem 8.6 (Diagonals Bisect)\n**Statement:** The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\n**Given:** $||gm$ $ABCD$, diagonals $AC, BD$ intersect at $O$.\n**Proof:**\n1.

Show that $BFDE$ is a parallelogram.\n17. **(Must Practice)** Prove that the figure formed by joining mid-points of adjacent sides of a rectangle is a rhombus.\n18. **(Must Practice)** ABC is a triangle right angled at C. A line through the mid-point M of hypotenuse AB and parallel to BC intersects AC at D. Prove $MD \\perp AC$.\n19. **(Must Practice)** Show that the diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles.\n20. **(Must Practice)** ABCD is a parallelogram and AP and CQ are perpendiculars from vertices A and C on diagonal BD. Prove $\\Delta APB \\cong \\Delta CQD$.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Formula & Concept Compendium\n\n#### 6.1 Properties Summary\n| Property | Parallelogram | Rectangle | Rhombus | Square |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Opp Sides Equal | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| All Sides Equal | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Opp Angles Equal | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| All Angles 90 | No | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Diagonals Bisect | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Diagonals Equal | No | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Diagonals Perp | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n\n#### 6.2 Key Theorems\n* **MPT:** Line joining midpoints of two sides is parallel to third and half of it.\n* **Converse MPT:** Line through midpoint parallel to second side bisects third.\n* **Condition for ||gm:** One pair of opp sides equal and parallel ($AB=CD, AB||CD$).\n\n#### 6.3 Proving Checklist\n* To prove **Rectangle**: First prove $||gm$, then one angle $90^\\circ$ OR diagonals equal.\n* To prove **Rhombus**: First prove $||gm$, then adj sides equal OR diagonals perp.\n* To prove **Square**: Prove Rectangle + Rhombus.",
