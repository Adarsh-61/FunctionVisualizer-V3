In Class IX, you explored the number line and the existence of **Irrational Numbers**—numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers[cite: 5]. In Class 10, we move beyond mere identification to understanding the deep logical structures that govern integers and real numbers.\n\n#### 1.1.1 The Hierarchy of Numbers\nTo understand Real Numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$), we must revisit the structure of the number system:\n1.  **Natural Numbers ($\\mathbb{N}$):** The counting numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n2.  **Whole Numbers ($\\mathbb{W}$):** Natural numbers plus zero $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n3.  **Integers ($\\mathbb{Z}$):** Whole numbers and their negatives $\\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n4.  **Rational Numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$):** Numbers of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $q \\neq 0$. Their decimal expansions are either **terminating** or **non-terminating recurring**.\n5.  **Irrational Numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}'$ or $\\mathbb{I}$):** Numbers that cannot be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$. Their decimal expansions are **non-terminating and non-recurring** (e.g., $\\sqrt{2}, \\pi$).\n\n**Real Numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$)** are the set union of Rationals and Irrationals ($\\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{Q} \\cup \\mathbb{Q}'$). Every real number corresponds to a unique point on the number line.\n\n#### 1.1.2 The Logic of Divisibility\nBefore discussing primes, we must ground ourselves in the logic of divisibility. The text introduces **Euclid's Division Algorithm** conceptually [cite: 8].\n\n**Statement:** Given any positive integer $a$ and another positive integer $b$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that:\n$$a = bq + r, \\quad 0 \\le r < b$$\n\n**Interpretation:** This is the formal statement of the \"long division\" process [cite: 10].\n* If $r = 0$, we say $b$ **divides** $a$ (denoted $b | a$).\n* This algorithm is the engine behind finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and understanding modular arithmetic.\n\nAlthough straightforward, this lemma is the foundation for the divisibility properties of integers[cite: 11].",

          "content": "### 2. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA)\nThe FTA is the bedrock of Number Theory. It bridges composite numbers and prime numbers.\n\n#### 2.1 Primes and Composites\n* **Prime Number:** A natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).\n* **Composite Number:** A natural number greater than 1 that has more than two factors (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9).\n\n#### 2.2 Theorem Statement\n**Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic):** Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur [cite: 79].\n\n**Mathematical Formulation:**\nFor any composite number $x$, there exist primes $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ such that:\n$$x = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\dots \\times p_n$$\nIf we arrange these primes in ascending order ($p_1 \\le p_2 \\le \\dots \\le p_n$), the factorization is unique [cite: 96].\n\n**Example Analysis:** Consider the number 32760 [cite: 66].\nUsing a **Factor Tree**:\n$32760 = 2 \\times 16380$\n$16380 = 2 \\times 8190$\n$8190 = 2 \\times 4095$\n$4095 = 3 \\times 1365$\n$1365 = 3 \\times 455$\n$455 = 5 \\times 91$\n$91 = 7 \\times 13$\n\nCollecting the primes: $32760 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13$ [cite: 74].\nRegardless of how you break the number down, you will *always* end up with three 2s, two 3s, one 5, one 7, and one 13. This is the **Uniqueness** guaranteed by the theorem[cite: 81].\n\n#### 2.3 Applications of FTA\n**A. Checking Digit Properties**\nCan $4^n$ end with the digit 0 for any natural number $n$? [cite: 101]\n* **Logic:** For a number to end in 0, it must be divisible by 10. This means its prime factorization must contain both **2** and **5**.\n* **Analysis:** $4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}$. The only prime factor is 2 [cite: 104].\n* **Conclusion:** Since the factor 5 is missing, $4^n$ can never end in 0[cite: 105].\n\n**B. Finding HCF and LCM**\nThe FTA provides a systematic method for finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) [cite: 107].\n* **HCF:** Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor [cite: 111].\n* **LCM:** Product of the greatest power of each prime factor involved [cite: 112].\n\n**Important Relation:** For any two positive integers $a$ and $b$:\n$$\\text{HCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b$$ [cite: 113].\n*Note:* This relation holds *only* for two numbers, not three[cite: 135].",

          "content": "### 3. The Logic of Irrationality\nWe know $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\pi$ are irrational. But how do we *prove* it? We use a powerful logical technique called **Proof by Contradiction**[cite: 185].\n\n#### 3.1 Theorem 1.2 (The Key Lemma)\n**Statement:** Let $p$ be a prime number. If $p$ divides $a^2$, then $p$ divides $a$, where $a$ is a positive integer[cite: 177].\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  Let the prime factorization of $a$ be $a = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n$[cite: 179].\n2.  Then $a^2 = (p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n)(p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n) = p_1^2 p_2^2 \\dots p_n^2$[cite: 179].\n3.  Given that $p$ divides $a^2$, $p$ must be one of the prime factors of $a^2$ (by FTA uniqueness)[cite: 180].\n4.  The only prime factors of $a^2$ are $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$. So $p$ must be one of these[cite: 182].\n5.  Since $p \\in \\{p_1, \\dots, p_n\\}$ and $a = p_1 \\dots p_n$, it follows that $p$ divides $a$ [cite: 183].\n\n#### 3.2 Proof: $\\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational\n**Theorem 1.3:** $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational[cite: 187].\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Assumption:** Assume, to the contrary, that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational[cite: 188].\n2.  **Definition:** Then $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{r}{s}$ for integers $r, s$. By dividing out common factors, we can write $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are **coprime** (HCF is 1)[cite: 194].\n3.  **Manipulation:** $b\\sqrt{2} = a \\implies 2b^2 = a^2$ (squaring both sides)[cite: 196].\n4.  **Deduction 1:** This means $a^2$ is divisible by 2. By Theorem 1.2, **$a$ is divisible by 2**[cite: 196].\n5.  **Substitution:** Let $a = 2c$ for some integer $c$. Then $a^2 = 4c^2$[cite: 197].\n6.  **Equating:** $2b^2 = 4c^2 \\implies b^2 = 2c^2$[cite: 198].\n7.  **Deduction 2:** This means $b^2$ is divisible by 2. By Theorem 1.2, **$b$ is divisible by 2**[cite: 199].\n8.  **Contradiction:** We have shown that 2 divides $a$ and 2 divides $b$. Thus, $a$ and $b$ have a common factor 2. This contradicts our initial condition that $a$ and $b$ are coprime[cite: 202].\n9.  **Conclusion:** The assumption that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational is false. $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational [cite: 205].\n\n#### 3.3 Operations on Irrationals\nWe can extend this logic to composite expressions.\n* **Sum/Difference:** The sum or difference of a rational and an irrational is irrational[cite: 228].\n    * *Example:* $5 - \\sqrt{3}$. If this were rational ($r$), then $\\sqrt{3} = 5 - r$. Since RHS is rational (rational minus rational), $\\sqrt{3}$ must be rational, which is false [cite: 232].\n* **Product/Quotient:** The product/quotient of a non-zero rational and an irrational is irrational[cite: 228].\n    * *Example:* $3\\sqrt{2}$. If $3\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$, then $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{3b}$. Since $a, 3b$ are integers, RHS is rational, implying $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational (False)[cite: 242].",

Find the maximum capacity of a container which can measure the petrol of either tanker in exact number of times.\n**Sol:**\n1.  We need a number that divides both 850 and 680 exactly.\n2.  We need the **maximum** such capacity, so we calculate HCF(850, 680).\n3.  Factorize:\n    $850 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 17$\n    $680 = 2^3 \\times 5 \\times 17$\n4.  HCF = Product of smallest powers = $2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 17^1 = 170$.\n**Ans:** 170 Litres.\n\n**Example 2: Composite Number Logic**\n**Q:** Explain why $7 \\times 11 \\times 13 + 13$ is a composite number[cite: 155].\n**Sol:**\n1.  Factor out 13: $13 \\times (7 \\times 11 + 1)$.\n2.  Simplify bracket: $13 \\times (77 + 1) = 13 \\times 78$.\n3.  Since the number has factors other than 1 and itself (specifically 13 and 78), it is composite by definition.\n\n**Example 3: Irrationality Proof**\n**Q:** Show that $5 - \\sqrt{3}$ is irrational[cite: 230].\n**Sol:**\n1.  Assume $5 - \\sqrt{3} = r$ (where $r$ is rational).\n2.  Rearrange: $\\sqrt{3} = 5 - r$.\n3.  LHS is $\\sqrt{3}$ (Irrational).\n4.  RHS is Rational - Rational = Rational.\n5.  Contradiction: Irrational cannot equal Rational.\n6.  Therefore, assumption is false. $5 - \\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.\n\n**Example 4: Circular Path LCM**\n**Q:** Sonia takes 18 mins and Ravi takes 12 mins to drive one round. If they start together, when will they meet again at the start? [cite: 156]\n**Sol:**\n1.  They meet when both have completed an integer number of rounds.\n2.  We need a common multiple of 18 and 12.\n3.  We need the *first* time, so LCM(18, 12).\n4.  $18 = 2 \\times 3^2$, $12 = 2^2 \\times 3$.\n5.  LCM = $2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36$.\n**Ans:** 36 minutes.\n\n**Example 5: Ending with Zero**\n**Q:** Check whether $6^n$ can end with 0[cite: 154].\n**Sol:**\n1.  $6^n = (2 \\times 3)^n = 2^n \\times 3^n$.\n2.  To end in 0, prime factorization must contain 2 and 5.\n3.  This factorization contains only 2 and 3. The factor 5 is missing.\n4.  Therefore, $6^n$ cannot end with 0.",
