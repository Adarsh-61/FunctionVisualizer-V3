          [cite_start]"content": "### 1. Introduction: The Meeting of Curves and Lines\nIn Class IX, we studied the circle as a static locus of points. In Class 10, we study the **dynamic interaction** between a circle and a straight line. This interaction is the foundation of calculus (tangents are derivatives), optics (reflection), and mechanics (gears and pulleys).\n\n#### 1.1 The Three Possibilities\nConsider a circle with centre $O$ and a straight line $PQ$ in the same plane. There are exactly three geometric possibilities regarding their intersection [cite: 1-2]:\n\n1.  **Non-intersecting Line:** The line and the circle have **no common points**. The distance from the centre to the line is greater than the radius ($d > r$).\n2.  **Secant:** The line intersects the circle at **two distinct points** ($A$ and $B$). The distance from the centre to the line is less than the radius ($d < r$). The portion of the line inside the circle is a *chord*.\n3.  **Tangent:** The line touches the circle at **exactly one point** ($P$). The distance from the centre to the line is exactly equal to the radius ($d = r$).\n\n#### 1.2 Defining the Tangent (The Limit Concept)\nWhat exactly is a tangent?\n* **Static Definition:** A line that intersects the circle at only one point.\n* **Dynamic Definition (Calculus Foundation):** Imagine a secant line intersecting the circle at points $A$ and $B$. If we rotate the line or move it such that the point $B$ moves closer and closer to $A$, the chord $AB$ shrinks. When $B$ finally coincides with $A$, the secant becomes a **Tangent**. The two points of intersection have merged into one.\n\n* **Point of Contact:** The unique common point between the tangent and the circle.\n\n#### 1.3 Theorem 10.1 (The Radius-Tangent Theorem)\n**Statement:** The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.\n\n**Given:** A circle with centre $O$ and a tangent $XY$ touching at point $P$.\n**To Prove:** $OP \\perp XY$.\n\n**Proof (By Logic of Shortest Distance):**\n1.  Take any point $Q$ on the tangent $XY$, other than $P$.\n2.  Since $P$ is the *only* point of contact, $Q$ must lie in the **exterior** of the circle.\n3.  Therefore, the distance $OQ$ must be greater than the radius of the circle.\n4.  So, $OQ > OP$.\n5.  This is true for *every* point on the line $XY$ except $P$. Thus, $OP$ is the **shortest distance** from the centre $O$ to the line $XY$.\n6.  In geometry, the shortest distance from a point to a line is the **perpendicular distance**.\n7.  Therefore, $OP \\perp XY$. **Q.E.D.**\n\n**Corollary:**\n* There can be only one tangent at a specific point on the circle.\n* The line perpendicular to a tangent at the point of contact passes through the centre. (This line is often called the **Normal**).",

What happens if the point is *outside*?\n\n#### 2.1 Number of Tangents\n1.  **Point Inside:** No tangent can be drawn. Any line passing through an internal point will cut the circle at two points (Secant).\n2.  **Point On Circle:** Exactly one tangent.\n3.  [cite_start]**Point Outside:** Exactly **two** tangents can be drawn to the circle [cite: 1-3].\n\n**Visual Logic:** Imagine holding a ball and placing a flat stick against it. You can touch it at one point. Now imagine creating a cone around the ball with the apex at the external point. The cone touches the ball along a circle, but in the 2D cross-section, these appear as two lines touching the circle.\n\n#### 2.2 Theorem 10.2 (The Two-Tangent Theorem)\n**Statement:** The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.\n\n**Given:** A circle with centre $O$, an external point $P$, and two tangents $PQ$ and $PR$ touching at $Q$ and $R$.\n**To Prove:** $PQ = PR$.\n\n**Proof (By Congruence):**\n1.  **Construction:** Join $OQ, OR$, and $OP$.\n2.  **Right Angles:** By Theorem 10.1, $OQ \\perp PQ$ and $OR \\perp PR$. So $\\angle OQP = \\angle ORP = 90^\\circ$.\n3.  **Compare Triangles:** In right-angled $\\Delta OQP$ and $\\Delta ORP$:\n    * $OQ = OR$ (Radii of the same circle).\n    * $OP = OP$ (Common Hypotenuse).\n    * $\\angle OQP = \\angle ORP = 90^\\circ$.\n4.  **Congruence:** By **RHS Criterion**, $\\Delta OQP \\cong \\Delta ORP$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By CPCT (Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles), $PQ = PR$. **Q.E.D.**\n\n#### 2.3 Additional Properties (Derived from Theorem 10.2)\nSince $\\Delta OQP \\cong \\Delta ORP$, other parts correspond too:\n1.  **Angle at Center:** $\\angle POQ = \\angle POR$. The line joining the centre to the external point bisects the angle between the radii.\n2.  **Angle at Vertex:** $\\angle OPQ = \\angle OPR$. The line joining the centre to the external point bisects the angle between the tangents.\n3.  **Supplementary Angles:** The angle between the tangents ($\\angle QPR$) and the angle subtended by the radii at the centre ($\\angle QOR$) are supplementary ($180^\\circ$).\n    * *Reason:* In quadrilateral $PQOR$, sum of angles is $360^\\circ$. $\\angle Q = 90^\\circ, \\angle R = 90^\\circ$.

Logic in Action: Complex Proofs\nUsing the two fundamental theorems (Radius-Tangent Perpendicularity and Equal Tangents), we can prove sophisticated geometric properties.\n\n#### 3.1 The Chord of Contact\nThe line joining the points of contact of two tangents from an external point is called the **Chord of Contact**. In our previous notation, the line $QR$ is the chord of contact for point $P$.\n* **Property:** The line $OP$ is the perpendicular bisector of the chord of contact $QR$.\n* **Proof:** In $\\Delta PQR$, $PQ = PR$, so it's isosceles. The line $PO$ bisects angle $P$. In an isosceles triangle, the angle bisector is the perpendicular bisector of the base.\n\n#### 3.2 Quadrilaterals Circumscribing Circles\nIf a quadrilateral $ABCD$ circumscribes a circle (touches it at 4 points), a powerful property emerges:\n**Property:** Sum of opposite sides is equal.\n$$AB + CD = BC + DA$$\n(We proved this in Example 10.2.3. It works for *any* circumscribing quadrilateral, not just parallelograms).\n\n#### 3.3 Circles and Triangles (Incircle)\nA circle inscribed in a triangle touches all three sides. The center of this circle is the **Incenter** (intersection of angle bisectors). The sides of the triangle act as tangents.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\nIf a circle touches sides $BC, CA, AB$ of $\\Delta ABC$ at $D, E, F$ respectively, then:\n* $AF = AE$\n* $BD = BF$\n* $CD = CE$\nThis allows us to set up algebraic equations to find side lengths if segments are known.",
