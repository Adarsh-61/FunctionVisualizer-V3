      "content": "### 1. Review of Prerequisites\nBefore diving into Class 12 concepts, we recall the rigorous definition of a relation from Class 11.\n\n**Cartesian Product:** Given two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, the Cartesian product $A \\times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$.\n$$ A \\times B = \\{ (a, b) : a \\in A, b \\in B \\} $$\n\n**Relation:** A relation $R$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is an arbitrary subset of $A \\times B$. If $(a, b) \\in R$, we say \"$a$ is related to $b$\" and write $a R b$.\n\n**Relation on a Set:** A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is a subset of $A \\times A$.\n\n### 2. Types of Relations\nWe categorize relations based on their internal structure and properties. Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $R$ be a relation on $A$.\n\n#### A. Trivial Relations\n1.  **Empty Relation:** $R = \\phi \\subset A \\times A$. No element of $A$ is related to any element of $A$. Example: Relation $R$ on set of boys $A$ defined by \"$a$ is sister of $b$\". Since no boy can be a sister, $R = \\phi$.\n2.  **Universal Relation:** $R = A \\times A$. Every element of $A$ is related to every element of $A$. Example: Relation $R$ on set of integers $A$ defined by \"$|a - b| \\ge 0$\". This is always true.\n\n#### B. Fundamental Properties (The Core Trio)\nThese three properties are crucial for defining mathematical structures.\n\n1.  **Reflexive Relation:**\n    A relation $R$ is reflexive if **every** element of $A$ is related to itself.\n    $$ \\forall a \\in A, \\quad (a, a) \\in R $$\n    * *Warning:* If even one element $a \\in A$ exists such that $(a, a) \\notin R$, the relation is NOT reflexive.\n    * *Example:* \"Is equal to\" (=) is reflexive because $a = a$.\n    * *Counter-Example:* \"Is greater than\" (>) is NOT reflexive because $a \\ngtr a$.\n\n2.  **Symmetric Relation:**\n    A relation $R$ is symmetric if whenever $a$ is related to $b$, $b$ is also related to $a$.\n    $$ \\forall a, b \\in A, \\quad (a, b) \\in R \\implies (b, a) \\in R $$\n    * *Example:* \"Is perpendicular to\" ($\\perp$) is symmetric. If $L_1 \\perp L_2$, then $L_2 \\perp L_1$.\n    * *Counter-Example:* \"Is father of\" is NOT symmetric.\n\n3.  **Transitive Relation:**\n    A relation $R$ is transitive if whenever $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $c$, then $a$ is related to $c$.\n    $$ \\forall a, b, c \\in A, \\quad [(a, b) \\in R \\land (b, c) \\in R] \\implies (a, c) \\in R $$\n    * *Subtlety:* If $(a, b) \\in R$ but there is no $c$ such that $(b, c) \\in R$, the condition is vacuously true, and transitivity is NOT violated.\n    * *Example:* \"Is less than\" (<) is transitive. $a < b$ and $b < c$ implies $a < c$.\n    * *Counter-Example:* \"Is perpendicular to\" in 2D plane. $L_1 \\perp L_2$ and $L_2 \\perp L_3$ implies $L_1 || L_3$, not $L_1 \\perp L_3$.\n\n### 3. Equivalence Relation\nA relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called an **Equivalence Relation** if it is Reflexive, Symmetric, AND Transitive.\n* Equivalence relations generalize the concept of \"equality\". They partition a set into disjoint subsets where elements within a subset are essentially \"the same\" under the given relation.\n\n### 4. Equivalence Classes\nLet $R$ be an equivalence relation on set $A$. For any $a \\in A$, the **Equivalence Class** of $a$, denoted by $[a]$ or $\\bar{a}$, is the set of all elements in $A$ that are related to $a$.\n$$ [a] = \\{ x \\in A : (x, a) \\in R \\} $$\n\n**The Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations:**\nAn equivalence relation $R$ on a set $A$ partitions $A$ into mutually disjoint equivalence classes whose union is $A$.\n1.  All elements in $[a]$ are related to each other.\n2.  No element of $[a]$ is related to any element of $[b]$ if $[a] \\neq [b]$.\n3.  $[a] \\cap [b] = \\phi$ or $[a] = [b]$.\n4.  $\\bigcup_{a \\in A} [a] = A$.\n\n* *Example:* Relation $R$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$ defined by \"$a - b$ is divisible by 2\".\n    * $[0] = \\{ ..., -2, 0, 2, 4, ... \\}$ (Even integers)\n    * $[1] = \\{ ..., -1, 1, 3, 5, ... \\}$ (Odd integers)\n    * These two classes partition $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### 5. Advanced Relation Types (JEE Focus)\n* **Antisymmetric Relation:** A relation is antisymmetric if $(a, b) \\in R$ and $(b, a) \\in R$ implies $a = b$. (Used in Partial Ordering, e.g., $\\le$).\n* **Partial Order Relation:** Reflexive, Antisymmetric, and Transitive. (e.g., \"subset of\" $\\subseteq$).\n* **Total Number of Relations:** If $n(A) = m$, total relations = $2^{m^2}$.\n* **Number of Reflexive Relations:** $2^{m^2 - m}$.\n* **Number of Symmetric Relations:** $2^{m(m+1)/2}$."

Definition Recap\nA function $f: A \\to B$ is a rule that associates **every** element of set $A$ with a **unique** element of set $B$.\n* **Domain:** Set $A$.\n* **Codomain:** Set $B$.\n* **Range:** Set of images = $\\{ f(x) : x \\in A \\} \\subseteq B$.\n\n### 2. One-One (Injective) Function\nA function $f: A \\to B$ is defined to be one-one (or injective) if the images of distinct elements of $A$ under $f$ are distinct.\n$$ \\forall x_1, x_2 \\in A, \\quad f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\implies x_1 = x_2 $$\nAlternatively: $x_1 \\neq x_2 \\implies f(x_1) \\neq f(x_2)$.\n\n**Tests for Injectivity:**\n1.  **Algebraic Method:** Assume $f(x) = f(y)$ and solve. If you get *only* $x=y$, it is one-one.\n2.  **Graphical Method (Horizontal Line Test):** If any horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once, it is one-one.\n3.  **Calculus Method:** For continuous differentiable functions, if $f'(x) > 0$ always (strictly increasing) or $f'(x) < 0$ always (strictly decreasing) in the domain, then $f$ is one-one.\n\n* *Counter-Example:* $f(x) = x^2$ is NOT one-one on $\\mathbb{R}$ because $f(2) = 4$ and $f(-2) = 4$, but $2 \\neq -2$.\n\n### 3. Onto (Surjective) Function\nA function $f: A \\to B$ is said to be onto (or surjective) if every element of $B$ is the image of some element of $A$ under $f$.\n$$ \\forall y \\in B, \\exists x \\in A \\text{ such that } f(x) = y $$\n**Condition:** Range of $f$ = Codomain of $f$.\n\n* *Example:* $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to [0, \\infty)$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$ is onto.\n* *Counter-Example:* $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$ is NOT onto because negative numbers in codomain have no pre-image.\n\n### 4. Bijective Function\nA function is **Bijective** if it is both **One-One and Onto**.\n* Bijectivity is the necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be **Invertible**.\n* Bijective functions set up a \"perfect pairing\" (one-to-one correspondence) between elements of $A$ and $B$.\n\n### 5. Counting Functions (JEE Advanced)\nLet $n(A) = m$ and $n(B) = n$.\n1.  **Total Functions:** $n^m$.\n2.  **One-One Functions (Injections):**\n    * If $m > n$: 0\n    * If $m \\le n$: $^nP_m = \\frac{n!}{(n-m)!}$\n3.  **Onto Functions (Surjections):**\n    * If $m < n$: 0\n    * If $m \\ge n$: $n^m - ^nC_1(n-1)^m + ^nC_2(n-2)^m - ... + (-1)^{n-1} ^nC_{n-1}(1)^m$ (Using Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion).\n4.  **Bijective Functions:**\n    * If $m \\neq n$: 0\n    * If $m = n$: $n!$"

      "content": "### 1. Definition\nLet $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to C$ be two functions. The composition of $f$ and $g$, denoted by $g \\circ f$, is the function from $A$ to $C$ defined by:\n$$ (g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)), \\quad \\forall x \\in A $$\n\n* **Visualizing:** It is a two-step machine. Input $x$ goes into $f$, output $f(x)$ becomes input for $g$, producing final output $g(f(x))$.\n* **Condition for Existence:** Range of $f$ must be a subset of Domain of $g$. ($R_f \\subseteq D_g$). If not, we must restrict the domain of $f$ to make it valid.\n\n### 2. Properties of Composition\n1.  **Non-Commutative:** In general, $g \\circ f \\neq f \\circ g$. In fact, if $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to C$, $f \\circ g$ might not even be defined.\n2.  **Associative:** Composition is always associative. If $f: A \\to B, g: B \\to C, h: C \\to D$, then:\n    $$ h \\circ (g \\circ f) = (h \\circ g) \\circ f $$\n3.  **Properties of Injectivity/Surjectivity:**\n    * If $f$ and $g$ are one-one, then $g \\circ f$ is one-one.\n    * If $f$ and $g$ are onto, then $g \\circ f$ is onto.\n    * If $g \\circ f$ is one-one, then $f$ MUST be one-one (but $g$ need not be).\n    * If $g \\circ f$ is onto, then $g$ MUST be onto (but $f$ need not be).\n\n### 3.

Definition of Inverse\nA function $f: X \\to Y$ is defined to be **invertible** if there exists a function $g: Y \\to X$ such that:\n$$ g \\circ f = I_X \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f \\circ g = I_Y $$\nwhere $I_X$ and $I_Y$ are identity functions on sets $X$ and $Y$ respectively.\n\nIf such a function $g$ exists, it is called the **inverse** of $f$ and is denoted by $f^{-1}$.\n\n### 2. Condition for Invertibility\n**Theorem:** A function $f: X \\to Y$ is invertible **if and only if** $f$ is a **bijective** function (one-one and onto).\n\n* **Reasoning:**\n    * To reverse the map ($Y \\to X$), every $y \\in Y$ must map back to something (requires $f$ to be Onto).\n    * Every $y \\in Y$ must map back to a *unique* $x$ (requires $f$ to be One-One).\n\n### 3. Finding the Inverse (Algorithm)\nTo find the inverse of $f(x)$:\n1.  Check if $f$ is bijective.\n2.  Let $y = f(x)$.\n3.  Solve this equation for $x$ in terms of $y$. You will get $x = g(y)$.\n4.  This function $g(y)$ is $f^{-1}(y)$.\n5.  Rewrite in terms of $x$ if needed: $f^{-1}(x)$.\n\n### 4. Properties of Inverse\n1.  **Uniqueness:** The inverse of a function, if it exists, is unique.\n2.  **Inverse of Inverse:** $(f^{-1})^{-1} = f$.\n3.  **Reversal Law:** $(g \\circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \\circ g^{-1}$. (Note the order reversal, similar to matrix inversion).\n4.  **Graph:** The graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the reflection of the graph of $f(x)$ along the line $y = x$.\n\n### 5. Graphs and Inverse Trigonometry Preview\nUnderstanding invertibility is critical for the next chapter (Inverse Trigonometric Functions). Since $\\sin x, \\cos x$ are periodic (many-to-one), they are not invertible on their natural domains. We must restrict their domains to make them bijective before defining inverses."

We denote $*(a, b)$ by $a * b$.\nBasically, it is a rule that takes two elements from $A$ and produces a third element also in $A$ (Closure property).\n\n* *Examples:* Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication ($\\times$) on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n* *Non-Example:* Division ($\\div$) on $\\mathbb{R}$ (because division by 0 is undefined, result not in $\\mathbb{R}$).
