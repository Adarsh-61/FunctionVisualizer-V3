          "content": "### 1. The Mathematics of Patterns\nHuman beings are pattern-seeking creatures. We observe patterns in nature—the spirals of a pine cone, the arrangement of petals in a sunflower, or the holes in a honeycomb[cite: 638]. In mathematics, we formalize these patterns into **Sequences**.\n\n#### 1.1 What is a Sequence?\nA sequence is an ordered list of numbers following a specific rule. Each number in the sequence is called a **term**.\n* **Example:** 1, 2, 3, 4... (Natural numbers)\n* **Example:** 100, 70, 40, 10... (Decreasing pattern) [cite: 683]\n* **Example:** 2, 4, 8, 16... (Multiplicative pattern)\n\n#### 1.2 Definition of Arithmetic Progression (AP)\nAn **Arithmetic Progression** is a specific type of sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the **Common Difference** ($d$) [cite: 701-702].\n\n**Formal Definition:**\nA sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_n, \\dots$ is an Arithmetic Progression if there exists a constant $d$ such that:\n$$a_{k+1} - a_k = d$$\nfor all natural numbers $k$.\n\n* **First Term ($a$):** The starting point of the sequence ($a_1$).\n* **Common Difference ($d$):** The fixed number added to the preceding term to get the next term[cite: 701]. It can be positive, negative, or zero[cite: 702].\n\n#### 1.3 Types of APs\n1.  **Finite AP:** An AP with a limited number of terms. It has a distinct **last term** ($l$) [cite: 721-722].\n    * *Example:* Heights of students in a line: 147, 148, ..., 157[cite: 709].\n2.  **Infinite AP:** An AP that continues indefinitely. It has no last term [cite: 723-724].\n    * *Example:* 1, 2, 3, 4, ... [cite: 682].\n\n#### 1.4 General Form of an AP\nIf the first term is $a$ and the common difference is $d$, the AP can be written as:\n$$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \\dots$$\nThis represents the structure of every possible arithmetic progression [cite: 718-720].\n\n#### 1.5 Identifying an AP\nTo check if a list of numbers is an AP, calculate the difference between consecutive terms ($a_2 - a_1$, $a_3 - a_2$, etc.). If these differences are all equal, the list is an AP [cite: 761-762].\n\n* **List:** 6, 9, 12, 15\n    * $9 - 6 = 3$\n    * $12 - 9 = 3$\n    * $15 - 12 = 3$\n    * Since differences are constant ($d=3$), it is an AP [cite: 757-762].\n* **List:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 5\n    * $1 - 1 = 0$\n    * $2 - 1 = 1$\n    * Differences are not constant. Not an AP[cite: 775].",

Generalizing the Progression\nIf we know the starting point ($a$) and the step size ($d$), we can predict the value of any term in the sequence without writing out all the preceding terms.\n\n#### 2.1 Derivation of the $n$th Term Formula\nLet's observe the pattern of terms in an AP [cite: 901-906]:\n* **1st Term ($a_1$):** $a = a + (1-1)d$\n* **2nd Term ($a_2$):** $a + d = a + (2-1)d$\n* **3rd Term ($a_3$):** $a_2 + d = (a+d) + d = a + 2d = a + (3-1)d$\n* **4th Term ($a_4$):** $a_3 + d = (a+2d) + d = a + 3d = a + (4-1)d$\n\nFollowing this logic, the $n$th term is obtained by adding $d$ exactly $(n-1)$ times to the first term.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$a_n = a + (n-1)d$$\nwhere:\n* $a_n$ is the $n$th term (General Term).\n* $a$ is the first term.\n* $n$ is the position of the term.\n* $d$ is the common difference.\n\n#### 2.2 Variables in the Equation\nThe equation $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ connects four variables: $a_n, a, n, d$.
