            "content": "### 1. The Necessity of Numbers\nMathematics is the language of the universe, and numbers are its alphabet. The classification of numbers is not arbitrary; it represents the historical and logical evolution of human thought.\n\n#### 1.1.1 The Hierarchy of Sets\nWe define numbers using **Set Theory**, which provides a rigorous foundation for modern mathematics.\n\n**A. Natural Numbers ($\\mathbb{N}$)**\n* **Definition:** The set of counting numbers. $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, \\dots\\}$.\n* **Peano Axioms (Advanced):** \n    1. $1$ is a natural number.\n    2. Every natural number $n$ has a successor $n+1$.\n    3. $1$ is not the successor of any natural number.\n* **Closure:** Closed under Addition ($+$) and Multiplication ($\\times$). Not closed under Subtraction or Division.\n\n**B. Whole Numbers ($\\mathbb{W}$)**\n* **Definition:** The set of Natural numbers union with the singleton set $\\{0\\}$. $\\mathbb{W} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n* **Role of Zero:** Zero is the **additive identity** ($a + 0 = a$). It represents the cardinality of an empty set.\n\n**C. Integers ($\\mathbb{Z}$)**\n* **Definition:** The set of Whole numbers and their additive inverses (negatives). $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n* **Origin:** From German *Zahlen* (to count).\n* **Structure:** $\\mathbb{Z}$ forms a **Ring** under addition and multiplication (Advanced). It allows for the solvability of equations like $x + 5 = 2$.\n\n**D. Rational Numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$)**\n* **Formal Definition:** A number $r$ is rational if $\\exists p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $r = \\frac{p}{q}$ and $q \\neq 0$.\n* **Standard Form:** A rational number is in standard form if $q > 0$ and $\\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$.\n* **Q as a Field:** $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest **Field** of characteristic 0. It supports $+$, $-$, $\\times$, and $\\div$ (by non-zero).\n\n#### 1.1.2 The Density Property of Rationals\nOne of the most profound properties of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is **Density**.\n* **Theorem:** Between any two distinct rational numbers $a$ and $b$ (assume $a < b$), there exist infinitely many rational numbers.\n* **Proof Strategy:**\n    * **Arithmetic Mean:** $m_1 = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is closed under addition and division by 2, $m_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Clearly $a < m_1 < b$.\n    * **Recursion:** We can find $m_2 = \\frac{a+m_1}{2}$, $m_3 = \\frac{m_1+b}{2}$, and so on ad infinitum.\n* **Method for finding $n$ rationals:**\n    1. **Mean Method:** Repeatedly take averages (tedious for large $n$).\n    2. **Denominator Method:** Convert $a$ and $b$ to equivalent fractions with denominator $k(n+1)$.\n\n#### 1.1.3 Euclid’s Division Lemma (Foundation)\nAlthough often introduced later, this is the bedrock of integer arithmetic.\n* **Statement:** Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying $a = bq + r$, where $0 \\le r < b$.\n* **Significance:** This lemma justifies the process of long division and is key to finding HCF (GCD).\n\n#### 1.1.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n* **Statement:** Every composite number can be expressed (factorized) as a product of primes, and this factorization is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur.\n* **Example:** $120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5$. No other set of primes multiplies to 120.\n* **Application:** This theorem is crucial for determining if a rational number has a terminating decimal expansion (discussed in 1.3).",

            "content": "### 1. The Crisis of Pythagoreans\nThe discovery of irrational numbers was a turning point in mathematics. The Pythagoreans believed all universe quantities could be expressed as ratios of integers. The diagonal of a unit square shattered this belief.\n\n#### 1.2.1 Definition and Properties\n* **Irrational Number ($\\mathbb{I}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}'$):** A real number that cannot be written as $p/q$ ($p,q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\neq 0$).\n* **Decimal Nature:** Non-terminating, non-recurring.\n* **Examples:** $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\pi, e, \\phi$ (Golden Ratio).\n\n#### 1.2.2 Formal Proofs of Irrationality\nThis is a standard proof by **Reductio ad Absurdum** (Proof by Contradiction).\n\n**Theorem:** $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Assumption:** Assume $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\neq 0$, and $\\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$ (coprime).\n2.  **Squaring:** $2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2} \\implies p^2 = 2q^2$.\n3.  **Deduction 1:** $p^2$ is even $\\implies p$ is even (since the square of an odd number is odd). Let $p = 2k$.\n4.  **Substitution:** $(2k)^2 = 2q^2 \\implies 4k^2 = 2q^2 \\implies q^2 = 2k^2$.\n5.  **Deduction 2:** $q^2$ is even $\\implies q$ is even.\n6.  **Contradiction:** We found both $p$ and $q$ are even, meaning they share a factor of 2. This contradicts the assumption that $\\text{gcd}(p, q) = 1$.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The assumption is false. $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\n\n**Generalized Theorem:** If $p$ is a prime number, then $\\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.\n* The proof follows the same logic using Euclid's Lemma: If prime $p$ divides $a^2$, then $p$ divides $a$.\n\n#### 1.2.3 Geometrical Representation\nEvery real number corresponds to a unique point on the number line.\n* **Locating $\\sqrt{n}$:** We use the Pythagorean Theorem ($h^2 = p^2 + b^2$).\n* **The Spiral of Theodorus:**\n    * Start with $\\Delta OAB$, legs 1, 1. Hypotenuse $OB = \\sqrt{2}$.\n    * Construct $BC \\perp OB$ with length 1. New hypotenuse $OC = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n    * Construct $CD \\perp OC$ with length 1. New hypotenuse $OD = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n    * This process continues to locate $\\sqrt{n}$.\n\n#### 1.2.4 Transcendental vs Algebraic Irrationals (Advanced)\n* **Algebraic:** Roots of polynomial equations with integer coefficients (e.g., $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $x^2 - 2 = 0$).\n* **Transcendental:** Numbers that are not roots of any such polynomial (e.g., $\\pi, e$).

To convert a fraction to a decimal, we essentially scale it to have a power of 10 in the denominator.\n\n2.  **Non-Terminating Recurring (Repeating):**\n    * A block of digits repeats infinitely (e.g., $0.333\\dots, 1.2727\\dots$).\n    * **Condition:** $p/q$ repeats if $q$ has prime factors other than 2 or 5.\n    * **Periodicity:** The number of repeating digits (period) is always less than the divisor $q$.\n\n3.  **Non-Terminating Non-Recurring:**\n    * No pattern repeats (e.g., $\\pi, 0.1010010001\\dots$).\n    * Corresponds strictly to **Irrational Numbers**.\n\n#### 1.3.2 Conversion: Decimal to Fraction ($p/q$)\n* **Terminating:** Trivial. $0.375 = \\frac{375}{1000} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n* **Recurring:** Requires algebra.\n    * *Method:* Let $x = 0.\\overline{block}$.

Algebra of Real Numbers\nFor positive real numbers $a, b$:\n* $\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}$\n* $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}$\n* $(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b}) = a - b$\n* $(a + \\sqrt{b})(a - \\sqrt{b}) = a^2 - b$\n\n### 3. Surds (Radicals)\nA surd is an irrational root of a rational number, e.g., $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt[3]{7}$.\n* **Pure Surd:** Entirely under the root (e.g., $\\sqrt{32}$).\n* **Mixed Surd:** Coefficient exists (e.g., $4\\sqrt{2}$).\n\n### 4. Rationalization of the Denominator\nThe process of removing radicals from the denominator to make calculation and estimation easier.\n\n**Type A: Monomial Denominator $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$**\n* Multiply numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{a}$.\n\n**Type B: Binomial Denominator $\\frac{1}{a \\pm \\sqrt{b}}$**\n* Use the **Conjugate**. The conjugate of $a + \\sqrt{b}$ is $a - \\sqrt{b}$.\n* Product: $(a+\\sqrt{b})(a-\\sqrt{b}) = a^2 - b$ (Rational).\n\n**Type C: Trinomial Denominator (Advanced)**\n* Example: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5}}$.\n* Strategy: Group terms, e.g., $(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{5}$. Rationalize once, then rationalize the resulting binomial.\n\n### 5. Comparing Surds\nTo compare $\\sqrt[n]{a}$ and $\\sqrt[m]{b}$:\n1.  Find $L = \\text{LCM}(n, m)$.\n2.

            "content": "### 1. Introduction: From Arithmetic to Algebra\nAlgebra is the generalization of arithmetic. While arithmetic deals with specific numbers, algebra deals with variables and generalized quantities. A **Polynomial** is one of the most fundamental structures in algebra, serving as a bridge between simple equations and complex calculus functions.\n\n#### 1.1 Variables and Constants\n* **Variable:** A symbol (usually a letter like $x, y, z$) that can take on various numerical values. It represents a quantity that can change.\n* **Constant:** A symbol (like $2, -5, \\pi$) that has a fixed numerical value. It represents a quantity that does not change.\n* **Algebraic Expression:** A combination of variables and constants connected by fundamental arithmetic operations ($+, -, \\times, \\div$). Examples: $2x + 3$, $\\sqrt{x}$, $1/x$.\n\n#### 1.2 Formal Definition of a Polynomial\nA polynomial in one variable $x$ is an algebraic expression of the form:\n$$p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$$\nwhere:\n* $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_0$ are constants called **coefficients**. These can be any real numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$).\n* $x$ is the **variable**.\n* The exponents $n, n-1, \\dots, 0$ must be **Whole Numbers** (non-negative integers: $0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n* $a_n \\neq 0$ (unless it is the zero polynomial).\n\n**Crucial Constraint:** An expression is **NOT** a polynomial if the variable $x$ has:\n1.  A negative exponent (e.g., $x^{-1} = 1/x$).\n2.  A fractional exponent (e.g., $x^{1/2} = \\sqrt{x}$).\n3.  An exponent that is irrational or complex.\n\n**Examples:**\n* $2x^2 + 3x - 5$: **Polynomial** (All exponents are whole numbers: 2, 1, 0).\n* $x + \\frac{1}{x}$: **Not a Polynomial** (Term $1/x = x^{-1}$ has a negative exponent).\n* $\\sqrt{x} + 2$: **Not a Polynomial** (Term $\\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$ has a fractional exponent).\n* $\\sqrt{2}x^2 + 5$: **Polynomial** (The coefficient $\\sqrt{2}$ can be irrational; only the exponent of $x$ matters).\n\n#### 1.3 Terminology\n* **Terms:** The parts of the polynomial separated by $+$ or $-$ signs. In $4x^2 - 3x + 7$, terms are $4x^2$, $-3x$, and $7$.\n* **Coefficients:** The numerical factor of each term. In $4x^2 - 3x + 7$, coefficient of $x^2$ is 4, of $x$ is -3, and constant term is 7.\n* **Constant Polynomial:** A polynomial containing only a constant term (e.g., $p(x) = 5$). Its degree is 0.\n* **Zero Polynomial:** The polynomial $p(x) = 0$. Its degree is **undefined**.\n\n#### 1.4 Classification by Terms\n* **Monomial:** A polynomial with exactly **one** term. (e.g., $2x, -5x^3, 7$).\n* **Binomial:** A polynomial with exactly **two** non-zero terms. (e.g., $x+1, x^2-5, 2x+3y$).\n* **Trinomial:** A polynomial with exactly **three** non-zero terms. (e.g., $x^2+x+1, 2x^3-5x+2$).\n\n#### 1.5 Degree of a Polynomial\nThe **degree** of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable present in the polynomial.\nLet $p(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots + a_0$ with $a_n \\neq 0$. Then $\\deg(p) = n$.\n\n**Classification by Degree:**\n1.  **Linear Polynomial ($\n = 1$):** General form $ax + b, a \\neq 0$. Graph is a straight line.\n2.  **Quadratic Polynomial ($n = 2$):** General form $ax^2 + bx + c, a \\neq 0$. Graph is a Parabola.\n3.  **Cubic Polynomial ($n = 3$):** General form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, a \\neq 0$.\n4.  **Biquadratic (Quartic) Polynomial ($n = 4$):** General form $ax^4 + \\dots$\n\n**Advanced Insight (BSc Level):** The set of all polynomials with coefficients in a field $\\mathbb{R}$ (denoted $\\mathbb{R}[x]$) forms a **Ring**. It has properties similar to integers (addition, multiplication, but not always division).",

The Remainder Theorem provides an elegant shortcut to find the remainder without performing long division.\n\n#### 3.1 Division Algorithm for Polynomials\nIf $p(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two polynomials such that $\\deg(p) \\ge \\deg(g)$ and $g(x) \\neq 0$, then we can find unique polynomials $q(x)$ (quotient) and $r(x)$ (remainder) such that:\n$$p(x) = g(x) \\cdot q(x) + r(x)$$\nwhere either $r(x) = 0$ or $\\deg(r) < \\deg(g)$.\n\n#### 3.2 The Remainder Theorem Statement\nLet $p(x)$ be any polynomial of degree $n \\ge 1$ and let $a$ be any real number. If $p(x)$ is divided by the linear polynomial $(x - a)$, then the remainder is $p(a)$.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  By division algorithm: $p(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)$.\n2.  Since divisor is degree 1, remainder $r(x)$ must be degree 0 (constant) or zero. Let $r(x) = R$.\n3.  Substitute $x = a$ into the equation:\n    $$p(a) = (a - a)q(a) + R$$\n    $$p(a) = 0 \\cdot q(a) + R$$\n    $$p(a) = R$$\n4.  Thus, the remainder is $p(a)$.\n\n#### 3.3 Application\nInstead of dividing $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1$ by $x-1$ to find the remainder, we simply compute $p(1)$.\n$p(1) = 1 + 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 = 2$.

The Great Convergence\nMathematics, for centuries, was divided into two distinct pillars: **Geometry** (the study of shapes, sizes, and space) and **Algebra** (the study of equations, symbols, and quantities). For a long time, these two worlds existed in parallel but rarely intersected.\n\n* **Geometry** was visual and axiomatic, pioneered by Euclid.\n* **Algebra** was symbolic and computational, developed by Al-Khwarizmi and others.\n\nThis separation ended in the 17th century with the arrival of the French mathematician and philosopher **René Descartes** (1596–1650). Legend has it that while lying in bed and watching a fly crawl on the ceiling, Descartes realized he could describe the fly's position uniquely using two numbers: its distance from two adjacent walls.\n\n#### 1.1 The Fundamental Problem of Position\nImagine a blank sheet of paper with a single dot on it. How do you describe the position of this dot to someone who cannot see the paper?\n* Saying \"it's in the middle\" is vague.\n* Saying \"it's near the top left\" is imprecise.\n* To be exact, you need a **Reference System**.\n\nCoordinate Geometry (also called **Analytic Geometry**) answers this fundamental question: *\"How do we define position precisely using numbers?\"*\n\n#### 1.2 The Impact of Coordinate Geometry\nThis field is not just about drawing graphs. It is the foundation of:\n* **Calculus:** Describing curves like $y = x^2$.\n* **Physics:** Mapping trajectories of projectiles and planets.\n* **Computer Graphics:** Every pixel on your screen has coordinates $(x, y)$.\n* **GPS Technology:** Your location on Earth is defined by Latitude and Longitude (a spherical coordinate system).\n\nBy converting geometric figures into algebraic equations, Descartes gave us the power to prove geometric theorems using algebra and to visualize algebraic equations as geometric shapes. This chapter introduces the **Cartesian Coordinate System**, the tool that makes this all possible.",

The Cartesian system provides this using two perpendicular number lines.\n\n#### 2.1 The Number Line (Review)\nRecall that a number line represents real numbers as points on a line.\n* There is a central point called **Zero (0)**.\n* Positive numbers are to the **Right**.\n* Negative numbers are to the **Left**.\n\n#### 2.2 The Cross: Axes and Origin\nTo create a 2D system, we take two number lines and cross them at their zeroes at a 90-degree angle.\n\n1.  **The X-Axis (Abscissa Axis):** The horizontal number line. \n    * Positive direction: Right ($OX$)\n    * Negative direction: Left ($OX'$)\n2.  **The Y-Axis (Ordinate Axis):** The vertical number line.\n    * Positive direction: Up ($OY$)\n    * Negative direction: Down ($OY'$)\n3.  **The Origin:** The point where the two lines intersect. This is the reference point for all measurements. Its value is zero on both lines.\n\n#### 2.3 The Plane\nThe flat surface containing these axes is called the **Cartesian Plane**, the **Coordinate Plane**, or the **XY-Plane**.\n\n#### 2.4 Quadrants: Dividing the Space\nThe two axes divide the infinite plane into four distinct regions called **Quadrants**. They are numbered counter-clockwise, starting from the top-right.\n\n* **Quadrant I:** Top Right. Bounded by positive x-axis and positive y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(+, +)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Right (positive) and Up (positive).\n\n* **Quadrant II:** Top Left. Bounded by negative x-axis and positive y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(-, +)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Left (negative) and Up (positive).\n\n* **Quadrant III:** Bottom Left. Bounded by negative x-axis and negative y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(-, -)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Left (negative) and Down (negative).\n\n* **Quadrant IV:** Bottom Right. Bounded by positive x-axis and negative y-axis.\n    * Any point here has $(+, -)$ coordinates.\n    * Logic: You move Right (positive) and Down (negative).\n\n**Critical Note:** Points lying *on* the axes do not belong to any quadrant.",

Defining Position Precisely\nEvery point $P$ in the Cartesian plane is associated with a unique pair of numbers called its **coordinates**.\n\n#### 3.1 Ordered Pairs\nThe coordinates are written as $(x, y)$. This is called an **Ordered Pair** because the order matters.\n* $(2, 3)$ is NOT the same as $(3, 2)$.\n* In $(2, 3)$, we move 2 units right, then 3 units up.\n* In $(3, 2)$, we move 3 units right, then 2 units up.\n\n#### 3.2 Abscissa (x-coordinate)\n* **Definition:** The first number in the pair.\n* **Geometric Meaning:** The perpendicular distance of the point from the **y-axis**.\n    * (Careful: x-coordinate tells you distance from y-axis).\n* **Direction:** Measured along the x-axis (Right/Left).\n* **Notation:** Often denoted by $x$.\n\n#### 3.3 Ordinate (y-coordinate)\n* **Definition:** The second number in the pair.\n* **Geometric Meaning:** The perpendicular distance of the point from the **x-axis**.\n    * (Careful: y-coordinate tells you distance from x-axis).\n* **Direction:** Measured along the y-axis (Up/Down).\n* **Notation:** Often denoted by $y$.\n\n#### 3.4 Coordinates of Special Points\n1.  **The Origin:** The intersection of axes. It is 0 units from y-axis and 0 units from x-axis. Coordinates: $(0, 0)$.\n2.  **Point on X-Axis:** Any point on the x-axis has zero vertical distance. Its ordinate is always 0. General form: $(x, 0)$.\n3.  **Point on Y-Axis:** Any point on the y-axis has zero horizontal distance. Its abscissa is always 0. General form: $(0, y)$.\n\n#### 3.5 Formal Mapping\nThere is a **one-to-one correspondence** (Bijective mapping) between the set of all points in the plane and the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n* For every point, there is a unique pair $(x, y)$.\n* For every pair $(x, y)$, there is a unique point.\n\n#### 3.6 Perpendicular Distance vs Coordinates\nThis is a common source of confusion.\n* Coordinates can be negative: $P(-3, -4)$.\n* Distance is always non-negative.\n    * Distance of $P(-3, -4)$ from y-axis is $|-3| = 3$ units.\n    * Distance of $P(-3, -4)$ from x-axis is $|-4| = 4$ units.",

The Art of Plotting\nPlotting a point means marking its exact location on the Cartesian plane given its coordinates.\n\n#### 4.1 Methodology\nTo plot a point $P(a, b)$:\n1.  Start at the **Origin** $(0, 0)$.\n2.  **Move Horizontally:** Look at $a$.\n    * If $a > 0$, move $a$ units to the **Right** along the x-axis.\n    * If $a < 0$, move $|a|$ units to the **Left** along the x-axis.\n    * If $a = 0$, stay at the origin horizontally.\n3.  **Move Vertically:** From your new position on the x-axis, look at $b$.\n    * If $b > 0$, move $b$ units **Up** parallel to the y-axis.\n    * If $b < 0$, move $|b|$ units **Down** parallel to the y-axis.\n    * If $b = 0$, stay on the x-axis.\n4.  **Mark the Point:** Draw a dot and label it $P(a, b)$.\n\n#### 4.2 Visualizing Reflection (Symmetry)\nPlotting teaches us about symmetry:\n* Points $(x, y)$ and $(x, -y)$ are mirror images across the **x-axis**.\n* Points $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$ are mirror images across the **y-axis**.\n* Points $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ are symmetric about the **Origin**.\n\n#### 4.3 Why Order Matters (Example)\nLet's plot $A(3, 1)$ and $B(1, 3)$.\n* For $A(3, 1)$: Move 3 Right, 1 Up.\n* For $B(1, 3)$: Move 1 Right, 3 Up.\n* Clearly, these are two different positions in the plane.

The area of the triangle formed by them is **zero**. This concept helps in testing collinearity.\n\n#### 5.3 Locus (The Path of a Point)\nA key concept in advanced geometry is **Locus**: The set of all points satisfying a specific condition.\n* **Example:** What is the set of all points $(x, y)$ such that $x = 3$?\n    * It is a vertical line passing through 3 on the x-axis. Every point on this line has abscissa 3 (e.g., $(3, 0), (3, 5), (3, -100)$).\n* **Example:** What is the set of all points such that $y = x$?\n    * It is a line passing through the origin at 45 degrees. Every point has equal abscissa and ordinate (e.g., $(1, 1), (-5, -5)$).\n\n#### 5.4 Line Equations (Preview)\nA linear equation $ax + by + c = 0$ represents a straight line in the Cartesian plane.

            "content": "### 1. From Unidimensional to Bidimensional Logic\nAlgebra is the study of structures and relations. In earlier classes, you mastered **Linear Equations in One Variable** (e.g., $x + 5 = 0$). These equations represent a single condition on a single quantity. Geometrically, their solution is a **single point** on a number line.\n\nHowever, the real world rarely operates on a single variable. Most phenomena depend on two or more changing quantities:\n* The cost of a taxi ride depends on *distance* and *time*.\n* The area of a rectangle depends on *length* and *width*.\n* The velocity of a projectile depends on *horizontal* and *vertical* components.\n\nTo model these relationships, we need **Linear Equations in Two Variables**.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definition\nA linear equation in two variables, say $x$ and $y$, is an algebraic equation that can be rearranged into the **General Form**:\n$$ax + by + c = 0$$\nwhere:\n1.  **Variables:** $x$ and $y$ are the variables (unknowns).\n2.  **Constants:** $a, b, c$ are real numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$).\n3.  **Non-Zero Condition:** $a$ and $b$ are not both zero. (Mathematically written as $a^2 + b^2 \\neq 0$).\n4.  **Linearity:** The exponent (power) of both variables is exactly 1. There are no terms like $x^2, y^3, xy, \\sqrt{x}, 1/y$.\n\n#### 1.2 Why \"Linear\"?\nThe term \"Linear\" comes from the Latin word *linearis*, pertaining to a line. \n* **Algebraic Reason:** The degree of the polynomial is 1.\n* **Geometric Reason:** When the solutions of such an equation are plotted on a Cartesian plane, they fundamentally and invariably form a **Straight Line**. (We will prove this relationship in Section 4.3).\n\n#### 1.3 Constraints and Degenerate Cases\nLet's analyze the condition $a^2 + b^2 \\neq 0$:\n* **Case 1: $a \\neq 0, b \\neq 0$:** This is a true two-variable equation (e.g., $2x + 3y = 5$). It represents an oblique line.\n* **Case 2: $a = 0, b \\neq 0$:** The equation becomes $0x + by + c = 0 \\implies by + c = 0 \\implies y = -c/b$. This is geometrically a horizontal line.\n* **Case 3: $a \\neq 0, b = 0$:** The equation becomes $ax + 0y + c = 0 \\implies ax + c = 0 \\implies x = -c/a$. This is geometrically a vertical line.\n* **Case 4: $a = 0, b = 0$ (Invalid):** The equation becomes $0 + 0 + c = 0$. If $c \\neq 0$, this is a contradiction (False). If $c = 0$, it is a tautology (True for all $x, y$). Neither represents a specific line.\n\n#### 1.4 Real-Life Modeling (The Art of Translation)\nMathematics is a language. Translating a word problem into an equation is a critical skill.\n* *Scenario:* \"The cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen.\"\n* *Translation:* Let cost of notebook = $x$, cost of pen = $y$. Relation: $x = 2y$ or $x - 2y = 0$.\n* *Scenario:* \"The sum of ages of two brothers is 20.\"\n* *Translation:* $x + y = 20$.",

            "content": "### 2. What is a \"Solution\"?\nFor an equation in one variable, say $2x - 4 = 0$, the solution is a single number $x = 2$. It is a specific value that satisfies the equality.\n\nFor two variables, a solution is not a single number, but a **pair** of numbers $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation simultaneously. \n\n#### 2.1 The Solution as an Ordered Pair\nA solution to $ax + by + c = 0$ is an ordered pair $(x_1, y_1)$ such that when $x$ is replaced by $x_1$ and $y$ by $y_1$, the LHS becomes equal to RHS (zero).\n\n* **Example:** Consider $x + y = 10$.\n    * $(5, 5)$ is a solution because $5 + 5 = 10$.\n    * $(1, 9)$ is a solution.\n    * $(-2, 12)$ is a solution.\n    * $(0.5, 9.5)$ is a solution.\n\n#### 2.2 Why Infinitely Many Solutions?\nThis is a fundamental concept often memorized but misunderstood.\n* **Algebraic Reason:** In the equation $ax + by + c = 0$, we have **two degrees of freedom** (two variables) but only **one constraint** (one equation). If we fix $x$, $y$ is automatically determined ($y = -(ax+c)/b$). Since we can choose *any* real value for $x$ (and there are infinite real numbers), there are infinite corresponding values for $y$.\n* **Geometric Reason:** The equation represents a line. A line is a collection of points. Since a line extends indefinitely and possesses the property of **continuum** (no gaps), it contains infinitely many points. Each point corresponds to a solution.\n\n#### 2.3 The Concept of Locus (Advanced)\nIn advanced mathematics, we view the equation as a **rule** or a **filter**. \nConsider the entire Cartesian plane (an infinite ocean of points). The equation $2x - y = 0$ acts as a filter. It asks every point $(x, y)$: *\"Is your ordinate exactly twice your abscissa?\"* \n* Point $(1, 2)$: \"Yes.\" -> You are on the line.\n* Point $(3, 5)$: \"No.\" -> You are not on the line.\nThe set of all points that say \"Yes\" forms the **Locus**, which happens to be a straight line.\n\n#### 2.4 Discrete vs Continuous Domains\nIdeally, $x$ and $y$ are real numbers (continuous line). However, context matters:\n* *Equation:* $x + y = 5$ where $x, y$ are **Natural Numbers**.\n    * Solutions: $(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)$.\n    * Total: Finite (4 solutions).\n* *Equation:* $x + y = 5$ where $x, y$ are **Real Numbers**.\n    * Solutions: Infinite (a continuous line segment between axes and beyond).",

For a linear equation, this graph is always a straight line.\n\n#### 3.1 Axiom of Line Determination\nFrom Euclidean geometry, we know that **two distinct points determine a unique line**. \nTherefore, to graph a linear equation, we theoretically need only two solutions. However, finding a third solution is recommended as a \"checkpoint\" to prevent calculation errors.\n\n#### 3.2 The Method of Intercepts (Most Efficient)\nThe fastest way to graph $ax + by + c = 0$ is often to find where the line cuts the axes.\n1.  **x-intercept:** Put $y = 0$ and solve for $x$. This gives point $A(x_1, 0)$.\n2.  **y-intercept:** Put $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. This gives point $B(0, y_1)$.\n3.  **Plot & Join:** Plot $A$ and $B$ and draw a line through them.\n\n#### 3.3 Lines Passing Through Origin\nIf the equation has **no constant term** (i.e., $c = 0$, like $y = 2x$), the line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$.\n* Here, putting $x=0$ gives $y=0$, and putting $y=0$ gives $x=0$. You get the same point twice.\n* You *must* pick a different value (e.g., $x=1$) to find a second point to determine the line.\n\n#### 3.4 Lines Parallel to Axes (One Variable Context)\n* **Equation $x = a$:**\n    * In one variable: A point $a$ on the number line.\n    * In two variables ($x + 0y = a$): A vertical line parallel to the y-axis, passing through $(a, 0)$. Every point on this line has abscissa $a$.\n* **Equation $y = b$:**\n    * In one variable: A point $b$ on the number line.\n    * In two variables ($0x + y = b$): A horizontal line parallel to the x-axis, passing through $(0, b)$. Every point on this line has ordinate $b$.\n\n#### 3.5 Reading the Graph (Slope Intuition)\nWhile formal slope ($m$) is taught later, observe the pattern:\n* Equation $y = x$: Line at $45^\\circ$.\n* Equation $y = 2x$: Line is steeper.\n* Equation $y = 0.5x$: Line is flatter.\n* Equation $y = -x$: Line slopes downwards.\nThis intuition connects the coefficient of $x$ to the steepness of the line.",

Ancient civilizations—Egyptians, Babylonians, Indians, and Chinese—used geometry for land surveying, architecture, and astronomy. However, their approach was empirical: they knew *what* worked, but they were not primarily concerned with *why* it worked.\n\nAround 300 BCE, a Greek mathematician named **Euclid** of Alexandria collected all known geometric knowledge of his time and organized it into a single, logical framework. His masterpiece, *The Elements*, is not just a book on geometry; it is the first comprehensive example of a **Deductive System**.\n\n#### 1.1 The Architecture of Mathematics\nTo understand Euclid's work, one must understand how mathematics is built. You cannot prove everything. If you try to define every term, you end up in an infinite loop of definitions. If you try to prove every statement, you need previous statements to prove them, leading to an infinite regression.\n\nTo resolve this, a mathematical system is built in layers:\n1.  **Undefined Terms:** The most basic building blocks (Point, Line, Plane) which we accept without definition to avoid circularity.\n2.  **Definitions:** Precise descriptions of other terms using undefined terms.\n3.  **Axioms & Postulates:** Statements assumed to be true without proof. They are the \"rules of the game.\"\n4.  **Theorems:** Statements that are proved to be true using axioms, definitions, and previously proved theorems.\n\nThis structure—starting from unproved assumptions to derive complex truths—is the essence of **Axiomatic Geometry**.\n\n#### 1.2 Undefined Terms: The Starting Point\nWhy do we leave some terms undefined?\nConsider the definition of a **Point**. Euclid defined it as \"that which has no part.\" But what is a \"part\"? If we define \"part\" as \"a portion of a whole,\" what is a \"portion\"? Eventually, we must point to a concept and say, \"We all intuitively understand this.\"\n\nIn modern geometry, we accept three concepts as undefined:\n1.  **Point:** Represents a location in space. It has no dimension (no length, breadth, or height).\n2.  **Line:** Represents direction and length. It has one dimension (length) but no breadth. It extends indefinitely in both directions.\n3.  **Plane:** Represents a flat surface. It has two dimensions (length and breadth) but no thickness. It extends indefinitely.\n\nWhile undefined, these terms are given properties through **Axioms**. For example, we don't define a line, but we define the *behavior* of a line via an axiom: \"Through any two points, there is exactly one line.\"",

            "content": "### 2. Euclid's Definitions (Book I of The Elements)\nEuclid began *The Elements* with 23 definitions. While some are mathematically archaic, they provide insight into how early mathematicians conceptualized space.\n\n1.  **\"A point is that which has no part.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* This implies indivisibility. A point is a zero-dimensional object. It is a location, not a substance.\n2.  **\"A line is breadthless length.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* This defines a 1D object. By stating it has no breadth, Euclid isolates the property of length.\n3.  **\"The ends of a line are points.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* This describes a line segment. It establishes the boundary relationship: a 0D object (point) bounds a 1D object (line).\n4.  **\"A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* This is arguably the most cryptic definition. It suggests uniformity and symmetry. If you look at a straight line from one end, it hides all the other points behind the first one.\n5.  **\"A surface is that which has length and breadth only.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* This defines a 2D object. No thickness.\n6.  **\"The edges of a surface are lines.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* Just as points bound lines, lines bound surfaces. This hierarchy of dimensions (Point $\\to$ Line $\\to$ Surface $\\to$ Solid) is central to Euclidean thought.\n7.  **\"A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.\"**\n    * *Analysis:* Similar to the straight line definition, it implies flatness. If you take any two points on a plane, the straight line connecting them lies entirely within the plane.\n\n#### 2.1 Moving to Modern Definitions\nWe now refine these historical definitions for precision:\n* **Collinear Points:** Three or more points that lie on the same line.\n* **Concurrent Lines:** Three or more lines that intersect at the same point.\n* **Intersects:** Two lines intersect if they share exactly one common point.",

Axioms vs. Postulates\nEuclid distinguished between two types of assumptions:\n* **Postulates:** Assumptions specific to geometry (e.g., about lines and circles).\n* **Common Notions (Axioms):** Assumptions applicable to all sciences (logic, magnitude, numbers).\n\nToday, we use the term \"Axiom\" for both. However, understanding Euclid's separation helps us see geometry as a specific application of general logic.\n\n#### 3.1 Euclid's 7 Common Notions\nThese are the rules of equality and inequality.\n\n**1. Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.**\n* *Logic:* If $A = B$ and $C = B$, then $A = C$. This is the **Transitive Property** of equality.\n* *Application:* Used in almost every proof to bridge two separate steps.\n\n**2. If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.**\n* *Logic:* If $A = B$ and $C = D$, then $A + C = B + D$.\n* *Application:* Adding line segments or angles.\n\n**3. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.**\n* *Logic:* If $A = B$ and $C = D$, then $A - C = B - D$.\n\n**4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.**\n* *Logic:* This is the principle of **Superposition**. If figure X can be placed exactly on figure Y so they cover each other perfectly, they are congruent/equal.\n* *Note:* Modern geometry avoids moving figures physically, but this was Euclid's primary way of proving congruence (e.g., SAS congruence).\n\n**5. The whole is greater than the part.**\n* *Logic:* If $B$ is a part of $A$, then $A > B$. This axiom defines the concept of \"magnitude\" or \"size.\"\n* *Limitation:* This holds for finite quantities. In modern set theory with infinite sets, a part can be equivalent to the whole (e.g., the set of even integers is equivalent in cardinality to the set of all integers). But in Euclidean geometry, we deal with finite lengths and areas.\n\n**6. Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another.**\n* *Logic:* If $A = 2X$ and $B = 2X$, then $A = B$.\n\n**7. Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.**\n* *Logic:* If $A = \\frac{1}{2}X$ and $B = \\frac{1}{2}X$, then $A = B$.\n\n#### 3.2 Consistency of Axioms\nA set of axioms must be **Consistent**. This means it is impossible to deduce a statement and its negation from the same set of axioms. If a system allows you to prove both \"Line L is parallel to Line M\" and \"Line L intersects Line M\", the system is broken (inconsistent). Euclidean geometry is consistent.",

Euclid's Postulates\nThese are the specific assumptions about geometric space.\n\n#### Postulate 1: Straight Line Construction\n**\"A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.\"**\n* *Implication:* Given two distinct points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line segment connecting them.\n* *Uniqueness Axiom:* A closely related modern axiom states, \"Given two distinct points, there is a **unique** line that passes through them.\" Euclid assumed uniqueness implicitly in his proofs, though he didn't explicitly state it in this postulate.\n\n#### Postulate 2: Terminated Lines\n**\"A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.\"**\n* *Clarification:* What Euclid called a \"terminated line,\" we call a **Line Segment**.\n* *Implication:* Space is infinite. You never hit a wall. If you have a segment $AB$, you can extend it towards $B$ to a point $C$, and further to $D$, forever. This establishes the continuous and infinite nature of the line.\n\n#### Postulate 3: Circles\n**\"A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.\"**\n* *Implication:* This guarantees the existence of circles and, crucially, the ability to transfer distances. If you have a segment length $r$, you can construct a circle of radius $r$ anywhere in the plane. This is the foundation of compass-and-straightedge constructions.\n\n#### Postulate 4: Right Angles\n**\"All right angles are equal to one another.\"**\n* *Why is this needed?* Isn't 90 degrees always 90 degrees?\n* *Deep Logic:* This postulates the **Homogeneity** and **Isotropy** of space. It means space is the same everywhere (homogeneity) and looks the same in every direction (isotropy).\n* If this were not true, a right angle measured at the North Pole might be \"sharper\" or \"wider\" than a right angle measured at the Equator.

Euclid's Fifth Postulate\nThis is the most famous and controversial postulate in the history of mathematics.\n\n**Statement:**\n\"If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of angles is less than two right angles.\"\n\n#### 5.1 Breaking it Down\nLet line $l$ intersect lines $m$ and $n$.\nLet the interior angles on one side be $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n* **Condition:** $\\alpha + \\beta < 180^\\circ$ (two right angles).\n* **Conclusion:** Lines $m$ and $n$ will intersect if extended on that side.\n* **Inverse Implication:** If $\\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ$, the lines never meet. They are **Parallel**.\n\n#### 5.2 Why is it Controversial?\nCompare Postulate 5 to Postulate 1 (\"Draw a line from A to B\").\n* Postulate 1 is simple, intuitive, and brief.\n* Postulate 5 is complex, wordy, and conditional.\nFor 2000 years, mathematicians felt Postulate 5 was not basic enough to be an axiom. It looked like a theorem. They tried to prove it using Postulates 1–4. \n**They all failed.**\nWhy? Because it *is* an independent axiom. You cannot derive parallel lines strictly from the concepts of points, extension, and circles.\n\n#### 5.3 Equivalent Versions (Playfair's Axiom)\nSince Euclid's version is cumbersome, John Playfair proposed a simpler, logically equivalent statement:\n**\"For every line $l$ and for every point $P$ not lying on $l$, there exists a unique line $m$ passing through $P$ and parallel to $l$.\"**\n\nThis asserts two things:\n1.  **Existence:** A parallel line exists.\n2.  **Uniqueness:** Only *one* such line exists.\n\nOther equivalents:\n* The sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n* Rectangles exist (quadrilaterals with 4 right angles).\n* If a line intersects one of two parallel lines, it must intersect the other.",

            "content": "### 1. Introduction: The Building Blocks of Shape\nGeometry is the study of shape, size, and relative position of figures. In Chapter 5, we established the axioms (rules) of Euclidean Geometry. Now, in Chapter 6, we begin applying these rules to the most fundamental elements of 2D space: **Lines** and **Angles**.\n\nEvery complex architectural structure, every triangular truss in a bridge, and every ray of light in optics can be analyzed using the concepts in this chapter. We are moving from \"looking at shapes\" to \"proving properties of shapes.\"\n\n#### 1.1 Basic Definitions (Recap & Refinement)\nBefore we argue about angles, we must agree on what our objects are.\n\n* **Line Segment:** A part of a line with two distinct end points. It has a definite length. Denoted as $\\overline{AB}$.\n* **Ray:** A part of a line with one end point (source) that extends indefinitely in the other direction. Denoted as $\\vec{AB}$. Examples: Sun rays, laser beams.\n* **Line:** A breadthless length that extends indefinitely in both directions. Denoted as $\\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.\n* **Collinear Points:** Three or more points that lie on the same straight line.\n* **Non-Collinear Points:** Points that do not lie on a single straight line (essential for forming triangles).\n\n#### 1.2 The Anatomy of an Angle\nAn **Angle** is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.\n* **Vertex:** The common end point (e.g., $O$).\n* **Arms (Sides):** The two rays forming the angle (e.g., $\\vec{OA}$ and $\\vec{OB}$).\n* **Measurement:** We measure the \"amount of rotation\" required to overlap one ray onto the other. The standard unit is **Degrees** ($^\\circ$), though advanced mathematics uses **Radians**.\n\n#### 1.3 Types of Angles (The Spectrum of Rotation)\nUnderstanding the magnitude allows us to classify angles:\n1.  **Acute Angle ($0^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$):** Sharp, narrow. Found in equilateral triangles.\n2.  **Right Angle ($x = 90^\\circ$):** The cornerstone of perpendicularity and trigonometry.\n3.  **Obtuse Angle ($90^\\circ < x < 180^\\circ$):** Wide, open.\n4.  **Straight Angle ($x = 180^\\circ$):** Looks like a straight line. The rays are opposite to each other.\n5.  **Reflex Angle ($180^\\circ < x < 360^\\circ$):** The \"outer\" angle. Often missed by students. Formula: $\\text{Reflex } \\angle A = 360^\\circ - \\angle A$.\n6.  **Complete Angle ($x = 360^\\circ$):** Full rotation.\n\n#### 1.4 Pairs of Angles: The Relationships\nGeometry becomes interesting when angles interact.\n\n* **Complementary Angles:** Two angles whose sum is $90^\\circ$. (e.g., $30^\\circ, 60^\\circ$).\n    * *Mnemonic:* \"C\" for Corner (Right Angle).\n* **Supplementary Angles:** Two angles whose sum is $180^\\circ$. (e.g., $110^\\circ, 70^\\circ$).\n    * *Mnemonic:* \"S\" for Straight (Straight Line).\n* **Adjacent Angles:** Two angles are adjacent if they have:\n    1.  A common vertex.\n    2.  A common arm.\n    3.  Their non-common arms are on different sides of the common arm.\n    * *Note:* Two angles can share a vertex and not be adjacent (e.g., vertically opposite).\n\n#### 1.5 The Linear Pair Axiom (Axiom 6.1 & 6.2)\nThis is a **fundamental truth** we accept without proof, which allows us to prove later theorems.\n\n* **Axiom 6.1:** If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is $180^\\circ$.\n* **Axiom 6.2 (Converse):** If the sum of two adjacent angles is $180^\\circ$, then the non-common arms of the angles form a line.\n\n* **Why is this crucial?** This axiom is our primary tool to prove a line is straight. If you calculate angles and find they sum to $180^\\circ$, you have proven collinearity.",

When Lines Meet\nThe intersection of two lines is the birthplace of the first rigorous proof in geometry.\n\n#### 2.1 Vertically Opposite Angles\nWhen two lines intersect, they form four angles. The angles opposite to each other at the vertex are called **Vertically Opposite Angles (VOA)**.\n* Intuition: If you take two scissors blades and open them, the angle between the top blades equals the angle between the handle blades. As one opens, the other opens identically.\n\n#### Theorem 6.1: VOA Equality\n**Statement:** If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal.\n\n**Given:** Two lines $AB$ and $CD$ intersect at point $O$.\n**To Prove:**\n1.  $\\angle AOC = \\angle BOD$\n2.  $\\angle AOD = \\angle BOC$\n\n**Proof (Step-by-Step Logic):**\n1.  **Identify Linear Pairs:**\n    Ray $OA$ stands on line $CD$.\n    Therefore, $\\angle AOC + \\angle AOD = 180^\\circ$ (Linear Pair Axiom). ---(i)\n\n2.  **Identify Another Linear Pair:**\n    Ray $OD$ stands on line $AB$.\n    Therefore, $\\angle AOD + \\angle BOD = 180^\\circ$ (Linear Pair Axiom). ---(ii)\n\n3.  **Equate:**\n    From (i) and (ii), both sums equal $180^\\circ$.\n    $\\angle AOC + \\angle AOD = \\angle AOD + \\angle BOD$\n\n4.  **Eliminate Common Term:**\n    Subtract $\\angle AOD$ from both sides (Euclid's Axiom: If equals are subtracted from equals, remainders are equal).\n    $\\angle AOC = \\angle BOD$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Similarly, we can prove $\\angle AOD = \\angle BOC$. Hence Proved.\n\n#### 2.2 Proof Writing Strategy\nNotice the structure above:\n1.  **Given/To Prove:** Sets the stage.\n2.  **Axiom Invocation:** We didn't invent logic; we used the Linear Pair Axiom.\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** We treated angles as variables.\n4.  **Conclusion:** We arrived at the truth definitively.\n\nThis method allows us to prove complex geometric truths by breaking them down into simple linear pair relationships.",

But in geometry, we define them by their *angular properties* when cut by a third line.\n\n#### 3.1 The Transversal\nA line which intersects two or more lines at distinct points is called a **transversal**.\n\nWhen a transversal ($t$) cuts two lines ($m$ and $n$), 8 angles are formed:\n* **Exterior Angles:** $\\angle 1, \\angle 2, \\angle 7, \\angle 8$ (Outside the parallel zone).\n* **Interior Angles:** $\\angle 3, \\angle 4, \\angle 5, \\angle 6$ (Sandwiched between lines).\n\n#### 3.2 Angle Relationships (The Vocabulary)\n1.  **Corresponding Angles:** Angles in the same relative position at each intersection. (e.g., Top-Right $\\angle 1$ and Top-Right $\\angle 5$).\n2.  **Alternate Interior Angles:** Interior angles on opposite sides of the transversal. Form a \"Z\" shape. (e.g., $\\angle 4$ and $\\angle 6$).\n3.  **Alternate Exterior Angles:** Exterior angles on opposite sides. (e.g., $\\angle 1$ and $\\angle 7$).\n4.  **Interior Angles on the Same Side (Consecutive/Co-interior/Allied):** Form a \"C\" shape. (e.g., $\\angle 4$ and $\\angle 5$).\n\n#### 3.3 Axiom 6.3 & 6.4: Corresponding Angles\nThis is the bedrock of parallel line proofs. We cannot *prove* corresponding angles are equal; we *assume* it to define parallelism.\n\n* **Axiom 6.3 (Corresponding Angles Axiom):** If a transversal intersects two **parallel** lines, then each pair of corresponding angles is equal.\n* **Axiom 6.4 (Converse):** If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of corresponding angles is equal, then the two lines are parallel.\n\n#### 3.4 Theorem 6.2: Alternate Interior Angles\n**Statement:** If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Given:** $AB || CD$, transversal $t$ cuts them. Angles: $\\angle 1$ (exterior), $\\angle 3$ (interior) at top; $\\angle 5$ (interior) at bottom.\n2.  **Axiom:** $\\angle 1 = \\angle 5$ (Corresponding Angles Axiom).\n3.  **Theorem:** $\\angle 1 = \\angle 3$ (Vertically Opposite Angles).\n4.  **Logic:** From (2) and (3), $\\angle 3 = \\angle 5$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Alternate interior angles are equal.\n\n#### 3.5 Theorem 6.4: Co-interior Angles\n**Statement:** If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary ($180^\\circ$).\n**Proof Logic:**\n1.  Linear pair at top intersection gives $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 = 180^\\circ$.\n2.  Alternate angles gives $\\angle 4 = \\angle 6$.\n3.  Substitute: $\\angle 3 + \\angle 6 = 180^\\circ$?? No, careful with indices.\n    * Correct Logic: $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 = 180$ (Linear Pair). $\\angle 1 = \\angle 5$ (Corresponding). Thus $\\angle 5 + \\angle 2 = 180$.\n\n**Common Mistake:** Students often think Co-interior angles are *equal*. They are not. They sum to $180^\\circ$. \"C\" for Complementary? No, \"C\" for \"Common sum 180\".",

So $\\angle 4 + \\angle 1 + \\angle 5 = 180^\\circ$ (Angles on a line).\n    * Substitute $\\angle 4$ and $\\angle 5$: $\\angle 2 + \\angle 1 + \\angle 3 = 180^\\circ$.\n    * Rearrange: $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 + \\angle 3 = 180^\\circ$.\n\n#### 4.2 Theorem 6.8: Exterior Angle Property\n**Statement:** If a side of a triangle is produced, then the exterior angle so formed is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.\n**Proof:**\n* Let exterior angle be $\\angle 4$. Interior adjacent is $\\angle 3$. Interior opposites are $\\angle 1, \\angle 2$.\n* $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 = 180^\\circ$ (Linear Pair).\n* $\\angle 1 + \\angle 2 + \\angle 3 = 180^\\circ$ (Angle Sum Property).\n* Equate: $\\angle 3 + \\angle 4 = \\angle 1 + \\angle 2 + \\angle 3$.\n* Subtract $\\angle 3$: $\\angle 4 = \\angle 1 + \\angle 2$.\n\n**Key Insight:** This theorem implies that an exterior angle is strictly *greater* than either of the interior opposite angles. This is crucial for inequality proofs.",

It is the only rigid polygon; unlike a square which can squish into a rhombus, a triangle cannot change its shape without breaking its sides. This rigidity is the foundation of engineering structures and geometric proofs.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definitions\n* **Triangle:** A closed plane figure formed by three intersecting lines. Defined by three non-collinear points $A, B, C$.\n* **Congruence ($\\cong$):** Two geometric figures are congruent if they have exactly the same shape and size. In Euclidean geometry, this means one can be superimposed on the other to cover it exactly.\n\n#### 1.2 Mathematical Congruence\nFor two triangles $\\Delta ABC$ and $\\Delta PQR$, congruence is not just equality of area. It is a **correspondence**.\n\nIf $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta PQR$, it implies six equalities:\n1.  **Sides:** $AB = PQ$, $BC = QR$, $AC = PR$\n2.  **Angles:** $\\angle A = \\angle P$, $\\angle B = \\angle Q$, $\\angle C = \\angle R$\n\n**CPCT (Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles):**\nThis is the \"Golden Hammer\" of geometry proofs. Once you prove two triangles are congruent, you can claim any corresponding pair of sides or angles are equal.\n\n* **Notation Warning:** Writing $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta QRP$ is **NOT** the same as $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta PQR$.

Advanced Criteria: SSS and RHS\nThese two criteria are theorems that rely on the properties of isosceles triangles.\n\n#### 4.1 Theorem 7.4: SSS Congruence (Side-Side-Side)\n**Statement:** If three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.\n\n**Proof Intuition:** Unlike SAS, we don't have angles. We must *construct* an angle. We place the two triangles base-to-base and use the properties of the resulting quadrilateral (two isosceles triangles).\n**Proof:**\n1.  Given $\\Delta ABC, \\Delta PQR$ with equal sides.\n2.  Place $\\Delta PQR$ such that $QR$ coincides with $BC$ but $P$ falls on the opposite side of $A$, forming $P'$.\n3.  Join $A$ to $P'$.\n4.  Since $AB = BP'$ and $AC = CP'$, $\\Delta ABP'$ and $\\Delta ACP'$ are isosceles.\n5.  $\\angle BAP' = \\angle BP'A$ and $\\angle CAP' = \\angle CP'A$.\n6.  Adding these gives $\\angle BAC = \\angle BP'C = \\angle P$.\n7.  Now we have SAS (Side $AB$, Angle $A$, Side $AC$).\n\n#### 4.2 Theorem 7.5: RHS Congruence (Right Angle-Hypotenuse-Side)\n**Statement:** If in two right triangles the hypotenuse and one side of one are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of the other, they are congruent.\n* **Warning:** This looks like \"SSA\" (which is invalid), but the Right Angle fixes the ambiguity.\n\n**Given:** $\\Delta ABC, \\Delta PQR$ with $\\angle B = \\angle Q = 90^\\circ$, $AC = PR$ (Hyp), $BC = QR$ (Side).\n**Proof:**\n1.  Extend $PQ$ to $S$ such that $QS = AB$. Join $S$ to $R$.\n2.  Prove $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta SQR$ (SAS).\n3.  This implies $AC = SR$ (CPCT).\n4.

This section establishes the logic of \"Greater Than\" in geometry.\n\n#### 5.1 Theorem 7.6 (Angle-Side Relationship)\n**Statement:** If two sides of a triangle are unequal, the angle opposite to the longer side is larger (greater).\n**Given:** $\\Delta ABC$ with $AC > AB$.\n**To Prove:** $\\angle B > \\angle C$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  Mark point $D$ on $AC$ such that $AD = AB$. Join $BD$.\n2.  $\\Delta ABD$ is isosceles $\\implies \\angle ABD = \\angle ADB$ (say $x$).\n3.  $\\|angle ADB$ is an exterior angle to $\\Delta BDC$.\n4.  Exterior Angle > Interior Opposite. So $x > \\angle C$.\n5.  $\\angle B$ (which contains $\\angle ABD$) is definitely $> x$.\n6.  Therefore, $\\angle B > \\angle C$.\n\n#### 5.2 Theorem 7.7 (Side-Angle Relationship)\n**Statement:** In any triangle, the side opposite to the larger (greater) angle is longer.\n**Logic:** Proof by Contradiction. If side is not longer, it is either equal (isosceles) or smaller (contradicts Thm 7.6).\n\n#### 5.3 Theorem 7.8 (Triangle Inequality Theorem)\n**Statement:** The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side.\n$$AB + AC > BC$$\n**Proof (Classic construction):**\n1.  Extend side $BA$ to point $D$ such that $AD = AC$. Join $DC$.\n2.  In $\\Delta ADC$, $AD=AC \\implies \\angle ADC = \\angle ACD$.\n3.  $\\angle BCD > \\angle ACD$ (Whole > Part).\n4.  $\\implies \\angle BCD > \\angle ADC$ (since $\\angle ADC = \\angle BDC$).\n5.  In $\\Delta BCD$, side opposite larger angle is longer: $BD > BC$.\n6.  $BD = BA + AD$. Since $AD = AC$, we have $BA + AC > BC$.

It generalizes the concept of a triangle (3 sides) to the next level of complexity.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definition\nLet $A, B, C, D$ be four points in a plane such that no three of them are collinear, and the line segments $AB, BC, CD,$ and $DA$ do not intersect except at their endpoints. The figure formed by these four segments is called the quadrilateral $ABCD$.\n\n* **Vertices:** The points $A, B, C, D$.\n* **Sides:** The segments $AB, BC, CD, DA$.\n* **Angles:** $\\angle A, \\angle B, \\angle C, \\angle D$.\n* **Diagonals:** The segments joining opposite vertices ($AC$ and $BD$).\n\n#### 1.2 The Angle Sum Property\nJust as the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.\n\n**Theorem 8.0:** The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.\n**Given:** A quadrilateral $ABCD$.\n**To Prove:** $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C + \\angle D = 360^\\circ$.\n**Construction:** Join diagonal $AC$. This divides the quadrilateral into two triangles, $\\Delta ABC$ and $\\Delta ADC$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  In $\\Delta ABC$: $\\angle CAB + \\angle B + \\angle BCA = 180^\\circ$ (Angle Sum Property of $\\Delta$). ---(i)\n2.  In $\\Delta ADC$: $\\angle DAC + \\angle D + \\angle ACD = 180^\\circ$. ---(ii)\n3.  Adding (i) and (ii):\n    $(\\angle CAB + \\angle DAC) + \\angle B + \\angle D + (\\angle BCA + \\angle ACD) = 180^\\circ + 180^\\circ$\n4.  From the figure, $\\angle CAB + \\angle DAC = \\angle A$ and $\\angle BCA + \\angle ACD = \\angle C$.\n5.  Therefore, $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C + \\angle D = 360^\\circ$.\n\n**Intuition:** Any $n$-sided polygon can be divided into $(n-2)$ triangles.

We will prove each property rigorously using triangle congruence (Chapter 7 concepts).\n\n#### Theorem 8.1 (The Diagonal Property)\n**Statement:** A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles.\n**Given:** $||gm$ $ABCD$ with diagonal $AC$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $AB || DC$ and $AD || BC$.\n2.  Take transversal $AC$.\n    * $\\angle BAC = \\angle DCA$ (Alt. Int. Angles).\n    * $\\angle BCA = \\angle DAC$ (Alt. Int. Angles).\n    * $AC = AC$ (Common side).\n3.  By **ASA Criterion**, $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta CDA$.\n**Implication:** This single theorem proves that opposite sides are equal and opposite angles are equal (via CPCT).\n\n#### Theorem 8.2 & 8.4 (Opposite Sides/Angles)\n* **Thm 8.2:** In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal ($AB=CD, AD=BC$).\n* **Thm 8.4:** In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal ($\\angle A = \\angle C, \\angle B = \\angle D$).\n* *Proof:* Follows directly from Thm 8.1 CPCT.\n\n#### Theorem 8.3 & 8.5 (Converse Tests)\nHow do we prove a quadrilateral is a parallelogram?\n* **Thm 8.3:** If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a parallelogram.\n    * *Proof:* Draw diagonal. Use **SSS** Congruence. Then corresponding angles equal $\\implies$ Alternate angles equal $\\implies$ Lines Parallel.\n* **Thm 8.5:** If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then it is a parallelogram.\n    * *Proof:* Use Angle Sum property ($2A + 2B = 360$) to show co-interior angles sum to 180.\n\n#### Theorem 8.6 (Diagonals Bisect)\n**Statement:** The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.\n**Given:** $||gm$ $ABCD$, diagonals $AC, BD$ intersect at $O$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  In $\\Delta AOB$ and $\\Delta COD$:\n    * $\\angle OAB = \\angle OCD$ (Alt Int, $AB || DC$)\n    * $AB = CD$ (Opp sides equal)\n    * $\\angle OBA = \\angle ODC$ (Alt Int)\n2.  $\\Delta AOB \\cong \\Delta COD$ (ASA).\n3.  $OA = OC$ and $OB = OD$ (CPCT).\n\n#### Theorem 8.7 (Converse Diagonal)\n**Statement:** If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then it is a parallelogram.\n**Proof:** Use SAS on vertically opposite triangles ($\\Delta AOB, \\Delta COD$) to prove $AB = CD$ and $\\angle OAB = \\angle OCD$ (Alt angles) $\\implies AB || CD$.",

It is the **longest chord** of the circle.\n    * *Proof of Longest Chord:* In any $\\Delta AOB$ formed by centre $O$ and chord $AB$, sum of two sides ($OA+OB = 2r$) > third side ($AB$).

Chords $AB$ and $CD$ such that $AB = CD$.\n**To Prove:** $\\angle AOB = \\angle COD$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  In $\\Delta AOB$ and $\\Delta COD$:\n    * $OA = OC$ (Radii of same circle)\n    * $OB = OD$ (Radii of same circle)\n    * $AB = CD$ (Given)\n2.

In right-angled $\\Delta OMA$ and $\\Delta OMB$:\n    * $OA = OB$ (Hypotenuse, Radii)\n    * $OM = OM$ (Common Side)\n    * $\\angle OMA = \\angle OMB = 90^\\circ$ (Given)\n2.

            "content": "### 1. The Concept of Area\nBefore calculating area, we must define it. **Area** is the measure of the region enclosed by a plane figure. In Euclidean geometry, the fundamental unit of area is a square with side length 1 unit ($1 \\text{ unit}^2$).\n\n#### 1.1 The Standard Triangle Formula\nWe know from earlier classes that the area of a triangle is given by:\n$$\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}$$\n\n**Derivation of Standard Formula:**\n1.  Take a triangle $\\Delta ABC$.\n2.  Enclose it in a rectangle with length equal to the base ($b$) and width equal to the height ($h$).\n3.  The triangle occupies exactly half the area of the rectangle formed by the altitude and the base.\n4.  Since $\\text{Area}(\\text{Rectangle}) = b \\times h$, $\\text{Area}(\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{2}bh$.\n\n#### 1.2 The Limitation (The Altitude Problem)\nThis formula is powerful but has a significant practical weakness: **It requires the Altitude ($h$).**\n\n* **Scenario A (Right Triangle):** Easy. The legs are the base and height. Area = $\\frac{1}{2}ab$.\n* **Scenario B (Equilateral Triangle):** Manageable. We can derive height using Pythagoras ($h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$).\n* **Scenario C (General Scalene Triangle):** Difficult. Imagine you are a land surveyor measuring a triangular field. You can easily measure the three outer boundaries (sides $a, b, c$) with a tape measure. However, measuring the \"height\" requires walking into the field, finding the exact perpendicular drop from a vertex to the opposite side. This is physically difficult and mathematically imprecise without advanced tools.\n\n**The Question:** Is there a formula to calculate the area of a triangle using *only* the lengths of its three sides ($a, b, c$), without needing to know the altitude?",

Use:\n    $$A = \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{(a+(b+c))(c-(a-b))(c+(a-b))(a+(b-c))}$$\n    This is algebraically equivalent but numerically stable for computers. (For Class 9, standard Heron's is sufficient, but this insight builds foundational computer science knowledge).",

These figures exist on a 2D plane; they have length and breadth, but no thickness. They have **Area** and **Perimeter**, but they cannot hold anything.\n\nNow, we step into the real world: the **3D World**. Objects here have length, breadth, and height (or thickness). These are called **Solids**.\n\n#### 1.1 Key Concepts\n1.  **Surface Area (SA):** The total area of all the faces (or surfaces) of the solid. It represents the amount of material (paper, cloth, paint) needed to cover the solid completely.\n    * **Unit:** Square units ($cm^2, m^2$).\n2.  **Volume (V):** The amount of space occupied by the solid. It represents the capacity of the solid to hold a substance (air, water, sand).\n    * **Unit:** Cubic units ($cm^3, m^3$).\n3.  **Lateral/Curved Surface Area (LSA/CSA):** The area of the side surfaces only, excluding the top and bottom bases. Useful for problems involving painting walls or making pipes.\n4.  **Total Surface Area (TSA):** The sum of the Lateral/Curved Surface Area and the area of the base(s).\n\n#### 1.2 The Dimension Logic\n* **1D:** Line (Length) $\\to$ Unit: $m$\n* **2D:** Plane (Length $\\times$ Breadth) $\\to$ Unit: $m^2$\n* **3D:** Solid (Length $\\times$ Breadth $\\times$ Height) $\\to$ Unit: $m^3$\n\n**Visualizing Capacity:** Imagine a hollow cube of side 1 cm.

In Class IX, you explored the number line and the existence of **Irrational Numbers**—numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers[cite: 5]. In Class 10, we move beyond mere identification to understanding the deep logical structures that govern integers and real numbers.\n\n#### 1.1.1 The Hierarchy of Numbers\nTo understand Real Numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$), we must revisit the structure of the number system:\n1.  **Natural Numbers ($\\mathbb{N}$):** The counting numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n2.  **Whole Numbers ($\\mathbb{W}$):** Natural numbers plus zero $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n3.  **Integers ($\\mathbb{Z}$):** Whole numbers and their negatives $\\{\\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n4.  **Rational Numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$):** Numbers of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $q \\neq 0$. Their decimal expansions are either **terminating** or **non-terminating recurring**.\n5.  **Irrational Numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}'$ or $\\mathbb{I}$):** Numbers that cannot be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$. Their decimal expansions are **non-terminating and non-recurring** (e.g., $\\sqrt{2}, \\pi$).\n\n**Real Numbers ($\\mathbb{R}$)** are the set union of Rationals and Irrationals ($\\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{Q} \\cup \\mathbb{Q}'$). Every real number corresponds to a unique point on the number line.\n\n#### 1.1.2 The Logic of Divisibility\nBefore discussing primes, we must ground ourselves in the logic of divisibility. The text introduces **Euclid's Division Algorithm** conceptually [cite: 8].\n\n**Statement:** Given any positive integer $a$ and another positive integer $b$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that:\n$$a = bq + r, \\quad 0 \\le r < b$$\n\n**Interpretation:** This is the formal statement of the \"long division\" process [cite: 10].\n* If $r = 0$, we say $b$ **divides** $a$ (denoted $b | a$).\n* This algorithm is the engine behind finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and understanding modular arithmetic.\n\nAlthough straightforward, this lemma is the foundation for the divisibility properties of integers[cite: 11].",

            "content": "### 2. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA)\nThe FTA is the bedrock of Number Theory. It bridges composite numbers and prime numbers.\n\n#### 2.1 Primes and Composites\n* **Prime Number:** A natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).\n* **Composite Number:** A natural number greater than 1 that has more than two factors (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9).\n\n#### 2.2 Theorem Statement\n**Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic):** Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur [cite: 79].\n\n**Mathematical Formulation:**\nFor any composite number $x$, there exist primes $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ such that:\n$$x = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\dots \\times p_n$$\nIf we arrange these primes in ascending order ($p_1 \\le p_2 \\le \\dots \\le p_n$), the factorization is unique [cite: 96].\n\n**Example Analysis:** Consider the number 32760 [cite: 66].\nUsing a **Factor Tree**:\n$32760 = 2 \\times 16380$\n$16380 = 2 \\times 8190$\n$8190 = 2 \\times 4095$\n$4095 = 3 \\times 1365$\n$1365 = 3 \\times 455$\n$455 = 5 \\times 91$\n$91 = 7 \\times 13$\n\nCollecting the primes: $32760 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13$ [cite: 74].\nRegardless of how you break the number down, you will *always* end up with three 2s, two 3s, one 5, one 7, and one 13. This is the **Uniqueness** guaranteed by the theorem[cite: 81].\n\n#### 2.3 Applications of FTA\n**A. Checking Digit Properties**\nCan $4^n$ end with the digit 0 for any natural number $n$? [cite: 101]\n* **Logic:** For a number to end in 0, it must be divisible by 10. This means its prime factorization must contain both **2** and **5**.\n* **Analysis:** $4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}$. The only prime factor is 2 [cite: 104].\n* **Conclusion:** Since the factor 5 is missing, $4^n$ can never end in 0[cite: 105].\n\n**B. Finding HCF and LCM**\nThe FTA provides a systematic method for finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) [cite: 107].\n* **HCF:** Product of the smallest power of each common prime factor [cite: 111].\n* **LCM:** Product of the greatest power of each prime factor involved [cite: 112].\n\n**Important Relation:** For any two positive integers $a$ and $b$:\n$$\\text{HCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b$$ [cite: 113].\n*Note:* This relation holds *only* for two numbers, not three[cite: 135].",

            "content": "### 3. The Logic of Irrationality\nWe know $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\pi$ are irrational. But how do we *prove* it? We use a powerful logical technique called **Proof by Contradiction**[cite: 185].\n\n#### 3.1 Theorem 1.2 (The Key Lemma)\n**Statement:** Let $p$ be a prime number. If $p$ divides $a^2$, then $p$ divides $a$, where $a$ is a positive integer[cite: 177].\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  Let the prime factorization of $a$ be $a = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n$[cite: 179].\n2.  Then $a^2 = (p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n)(p_1 p_2 \\dots p_n) = p_1^2 p_2^2 \\dots p_n^2$[cite: 179].\n3.  Given that $p$ divides $a^2$, $p$ must be one of the prime factors of $a^2$ (by FTA uniqueness)[cite: 180].\n4.  The only prime factors of $a^2$ are $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$. So $p$ must be one of these[cite: 182].\n5.  Since $p \\in \\{p_1, \\dots, p_n\\}$ and $a = p_1 \\dots p_n$, it follows that $p$ divides $a$ [cite: 183].\n\n#### 3.2 Proof: $\\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational\n**Theorem 1.3:** $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational[cite: 187].\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Assumption:** Assume, to the contrary, that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational[cite: 188].\n2.  **Definition:** Then $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{r}{s}$ for integers $r, s$. By dividing out common factors, we can write $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are **coprime** (HCF is 1)[cite: 194].\n3.  **Manipulation:** $b\\sqrt{2} = a \\implies 2b^2 = a^2$ (squaring both sides)[cite: 196].\n4.  **Deduction 1:** This means $a^2$ is divisible by 2. By Theorem 1.2, **$a$ is divisible by 2**[cite: 196].\n5.  **Substitution:** Let $a = 2c$ for some integer $c$. Then $a^2 = 4c^2$[cite: 197].\n6.  **Equating:** $2b^2 = 4c^2 \\implies b^2 = 2c^2$[cite: 198].\n7.  **Deduction 2:** This means $b^2$ is divisible by 2. By Theorem 1.2, **$b$ is divisible by 2**[cite: 199].\n8.  **Contradiction:** We have shown that 2 divides $a$ and 2 divides $b$. Thus, $a$ and $b$ have a common factor 2. This contradicts our initial condition that $a$ and $b$ are coprime[cite: 202].\n9.  **Conclusion:** The assumption that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational is false. $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational [cite: 205].\n\n#### 3.3 Operations on Irrationals\nWe can extend this logic to composite expressions.\n* **Sum/Difference:** The sum or difference of a rational and an irrational is irrational[cite: 228].\n    * *Example:* $5 - \\sqrt{3}$. If this were rational ($r$), then $\\sqrt{3} = 5 - r$. Since RHS is rational (rational minus rational), $\\sqrt{3}$ must be rational, which is false [cite: 232].\n* **Product/Quotient:** The product/quotient of a non-zero rational and an irrational is irrational[cite: 228].\n    * *Example:* $3\\sqrt{2}$. If $3\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$, then $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{3b}$. Since $a, 3b$ are integers, RHS is rational, implying $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational (False)[cite: 242].",

We need the **maximum** such capacity, so we calculate HCF(850, 680).\n3.  Factorize:\n    $850 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 17$\n    $680 = 2^3 \\times 5 \\times 17$\n4.

Factor out 13: $13 \\times (7 \\times 11 + 1)$.\n2.  Simplify bracket: $13 \\times (77 + 1) = 13 \\times 78$.\n3.  Since the number has factors other than 1 and itself (specifically 13 and 78), it is composite by definition.\n\n**Example 3: Irrationality Proof**\n**Q:** Show that $5 - \\sqrt{3}$ is irrational[cite: 230].\n**Sol:**\n1.  Assume $5 - \\sqrt{3} = r$ (where $r$ is rational).\n2.  Rearrange: $\\sqrt{3} = 5 - r$.\n3.  LHS is $\\sqrt{3}$ (Irrational).\n4.  RHS is Rational - Rational = Rational.\n5.  Contradiction: Irrational cannot equal Rational.\n6.

To end in 0, prime factorization must contain 2 and 5.\n3.  This factorization contains only 2 and 3. The factor 5 is missing.\n4.  Therefore, $6^n$ cannot end with 0.",

In Class IX, you learned the definition of a polynomial in one variable. Now, we will explore their deeper properties, geometric behaviors, and the hidden relationships between their roots and coefficients.\n\n#### 1.1 What is a Polynomial?\nA polynomial $p(x)$ in one variable $x$ is an algebraic expression of the form:\n$$p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$$\nwhere:\n* $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are constants (real numbers) called **coefficients**.\n* $a_n \\neq 0$ (Leading coefficient).\n* $n$ is a **non-negative integer** (Whole Number) called the **Degree** of the polynomial.\n\n**Crucial Distinction:** Expressions like $\\sqrt{x}+2$, $\\frac{1}{x-1}$, or $x^{3/2}$ are **NOT** polynomials because the exponent of the variable is not a whole number[cite: 278].\n\n#### 1.2 Classification by Degree\nThe **degree** dictates the behavior of the polynomial.\n1.  **Linear Polynomial (Degree 1):**\n    * Form: $ax + b, \\quad a \\neq 0$.\n    * Examples: $2x - 3$, $\\sqrt{3}x + 5$[cite: 280].\n    * Graph: A straight line.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Polynomial (Degree 2):**\n    * Form: $ax^2 + bx + c, \\quad a \\neq 0$.\n    * Origin: 'Quadrate' means square [cite: 283].\n    * Examples: $2x^2 + 3x - \\frac{2}{5}$, $y^2 - 2$ [cite: 283-285].\n    * Graph: A Parabola.\n\n3.  **Cubic Polynomial (Degree 3):**\n    * Form: $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, \\quad a \\neq 0$ [cite: 295].\n    * Examples: $x^3$, $\\sqrt{2}x^3$, $3x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1$ [cite: 293].\n\n#### 1.3 Value vs. Zero of a Polynomial\nIt is vital to distinguish between the *value* of a function and its *zero*.\n* **Value at $k$:** If we replace $x$ with a real number $k$ in $p(x)$, the result $p(k)$ is the value.\n    * *Example:* For $p(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4$, value at $x=2$ is $p(2) = 2^2 - 3(2) - 4 = -6$[cite: 297].\n* **Zero of Polynomial:** A real number $k$ is a **zero** if and only if $p(k) = 0$.\n    * *Example:* $p(-1) = (-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0$.

Geometrically, finding a zero is equivalent to finding where a curve touches the ground (the x-axis).\n\n#### 2.1 Linear Polynomials ($ax + b$)\nThe graph of $y = ax + b$ is always a **straight line** [cite: 320].\n* It intersects the x-axis at exactly one point.\n* The coordinate of intersection is $(-\\frac{b}{a}, 0)$.\n* Thus, a linear polynomial has exactly **one** zero [cite: 339].\n\n#### 2.2 Quadratic Polynomials ($ax^2 + bx + c$)\nThe graph of a quadratic polynomial is a curve called a **Parabola**[cite: 361].\n* **Shape:** If $a > 0$, it opens **upwards** ($\\cup$). If $a < 0$, it opens **downwards** ($\\cap$) [cite: 352-361].\n* **Intersection with X-axis:** The x-coordinates of the intersection points are the zeroes.\n\n**Three Cases of Intersection:**\n1.  **Two Distinct Points:** The graph cuts the x-axis at two separate points $A$ and $A'$.\n    * Result: **2 distinct zeroes** [cite: 377-379].\n    * Algebraic condition: Discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac > 0$.\n2.  **One Point (Touching):** The graph touches the x-axis at exactly one point $A$ (the vertex).\n    * Result: **2 equal zeroes** (appears as 1 unique zero) [cite: 384-390].\n    * Algebraic condition: $D = 0$.\n3.  **No Intersection:** The graph is entirely above or below the x-axis.\n    * Result: **No real zeroes** [cite: 395-403].\n    * Algebraic condition: $D < 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:** A quadratic polynomial has **at most** 2 real zeroes [cite: 405].\n\n#### 2.3 Cubic Polynomials ($ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$)\nThe graph of a cubic polynomial is a curve that can bend twice.\n* It can cross the x-axis at 1, 2, or 3 points.\n* **Example:** $y = x^3 - 4x$ cuts the axis at -2, 0, and 2. Hence, 3 zeroes [cite: 413].\n* **Example:** $y = x^3$ cuts only at 0. Hence, 1 zero [cite: 437].\n* **Conclusion:** A polynomial of degree $n$ has **at most** $n$ zeroes[cite: 444].",

            "content": "### 1. The Power of Two\nIn Class IX, we studied linear equations in *one* variable (e.g., $2x + 5 = 0$), which represents a point on a number line. We also introduced linear equations in *two* variables (e.g., $ax + by + c = 0$), which represents a **straight line** in the Euclidean plane. [cite: 363-366]\n\nNow, we step into the world of **Systems**. Real-world problems rarely depend on a single constraint. Usually, multiple conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.\n* **Example:** \"The number of rides Akhila had is half the number of times she played Hoopla,\" AND \"Total cost was ₹20.\" [cite: 367-370].\n\nThese two conditions form a **Pair of Linear Equations**. Finding a solution means finding a state of the world that satisfies *both* conditions at the same time.\n\n#### 1.1 Mathematical Definition\nA pair of linear equations in two variables $x$ and $y$ is generally of the form:\n$$a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0$$\n$$a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0$$\nwhere $a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2, b_2, c_2$ are real numbers, and $a_1^2 + b_1^2 \\neq 0$, $a_2^2 + b_2^2 \\neq 0$.\n\n#### 1.2 The Geometric Interpretation\nSince every linear equation represents a line, a pair of equations represents **two lines** on the same Cartesian plane. There are only three logical possibilities for two lines in a plane:\n\n1.  **Intersecting Lines:** The lines cross at exactly one unique point. This point is the **Unique Solution**. The system is **Consistent**.\n2.  **Parallel Lines:** The lines never meet. There is **No Solution**. The system is **Inconsistent**.\n3.  **Coincident Lines:** The lines lie exactly on top of each other. Every point on the line is a solution. There are **Infinitely Many Solutions**. The system is **Dependent (and Consistent)**. [cite: 364-365]\n\nThis geometric intuition is the foundation of Linear Algebra. The question \"Does a solution exist?\" is equivalent to \"Do the lines meet?\"",

These model situations where change is constant (e.g., buying items at a fixed price). However, nature and geometry often involve **products** of variables, leading to terms with degree 2.\n\n#### 1.1 The Necessity of Degree 2\nConsider this problem: *\"A charity trust wants to build a prayer hall with a carpet area of 300 sq m. The length must be one metre more than twice its breadth.\"* [cite: 1]\n\n* Let Breadth = $x$ metres.\n* Then Length = $(2x + 1)$ metres.\n* Area = Length $\\times$ Breadth = $(2x+1) \\cdot x$.\n* Equation: $2x^2 + x = 300 \\implies 2x^2 + x - 300 = 0$.\n\nThis is not a linear equation. It involves $x^2$. This is a **Quadratic Equation**.\n\n#### 1.2 Formal Definition\nA quadratic equation in the variable $x$ is an equation of the form:\n$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$\nwhere $a, b, c$ are real numbers and **$a \\neq 0$**.\n\n* **Standard Form:** Writing the equation in descending powers of $x$ (i.e., $x^2$ term, then $x$ term, then constant).\n* **Why $a \\neq 0$?** If $a=0$, the equation becomes $bx+c=0$, which is linear, not quadratic.\n\n#### 1.3 Roots vs Zeroes\n* **Polynomial Context:** For $p(x) = ax^2+bx+c$, the values of $x$ for which $p(x)=0$ are called **Zeroes**.\n* **Equation Context:** For $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are called **Roots**.\n* *Conceptually, they are the same thing.* Solving a quadratic equation is equivalent to finding the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial.\n\n#### 1.4 Historical Note\nQuadratic equations have been studied since antiquity. The Babylonians (c. 2000 BC) solved problems equivalent to quadratics. Euclid developed a geometric approach. Brahmagupta (AD 598–665) gave an explicit formula nearly identical to the modern one.

            "content": "### 3. The Geometric Origin of the Formula\nFactorisation fails when roots are irrational (e.g., $x^2 - 2 = 0$). We need a method to handle *any* quadratic. This method is **Completing the Square**.\n\n#### 3.1 The Intuition\nConsider $x^2 + 4x$. This is not a perfect square. A perfect square looks like $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$.\nComparing $x^2 + 4x$ with $x^2 + 2ax$, we see $2a = 4 \\implies a = 2$.\nTo make it a perfect square, we need to add $a^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\nSo, $x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x+2)^2$.\n\n**General Rule:** To complete the square for $x^2 + bx$, add $(\\frac{b}{2})^2$.\n\n#### 3.2 The Method Step-by-Step\nTo solve $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n1.  **Isolate constant:** $ax^2 + bx = -c$.\n2.  **Make leading coeff 1:** Divide by $a$: $x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x = -\\frac{c}{a}$.\n3.  **Complete the square:** Add $(\\frac{1}{2} \\text{coeff of } x)^2$ to both sides. i.e., add $(\\frac{b}{2a})^2$.\n4.  **Factor:** The LHS becomes $(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2$.\n5.  **Solve:** Take square root and rearrange.\n\n#### 3.3 Derivation of the Quadratic Formula\nLet's apply this method to the general form. This is one of the most important derivations in high school algebra.\n\n1.  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$\n2.  $x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x = -\\frac{c}{a}$ (Divide by $a$)\n3.  Add $(\\frac{b}{2a})^2$ to both sides:\n    $$x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + (\\frac{b}{2a})^2 = -\\frac{c}{a} + (\\frac{b}{2a})^2$$\n4.  Factor LHS and simplify RHS:\n    $$(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2 = -\\frac{c}{a} + \\frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$\n    $$(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2 = \\frac{-4ac + b^2}{4a^2}$$\n    $$(x + \\frac{b}{2a})^2 = \\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$$\n5.  Take square roots:\n    $$x + \\frac{b}{2a} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$$\n    $$x + \\frac{b}{2a} = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n6.  Isolate $x$:\n    $$x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n    $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nThis is the **Quadratic Formula**.",

This term $D$ is called the **Discriminant** because it discriminates (determines) the nature of the roots.\n\n#### 4.1 The Three Cases\nSince $D$ is inside a square root, its sign controls the outcome:\n\n1.  **Case 1: $D > 0$ (Two Distinct Real Roots)**\n    * $\\sqrt{D}$ is a positive real number.\n    * We get two values: $\\frac{-b + \\sqrt{D}}{2a}$ and $\\frac{-b - \\sqrt{D}}{2a}$.\n    * **Geometric Meaning:** The parabola cuts the x-axis at two distinct points.\n\n2.  **Case 2: $D = 0$ (Two Equal Real Roots)**\n    * $\\sqrt{D} = 0$.\n    * Roots are $\\frac{-b \\pm 0}{2a} = \\frac{-b}{2a}$.\n    * We say the roots are coincident or repeated.\n    * **Geometric Meaning:** The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point (the vertex).\n\n3.  **Case 3: $D < 0$ (No Real Roots)**\n    * $\\sqrt{D}$ involves the square root of a negative number, which is not real (it is imaginary).\n    * There are no real solutions.\n    * **Geometric Meaning:** The parabola lies entirely above or below the x-axis and never crosses it.\n\n#### 4.2 Application in Problem Solving\nDetermining the nature of roots is often the first step in solving applied problems (e.g., checking if a rectangular park with specific dimensions is possible).",

We observe patterns in nature—the spirals of a pine cone, the arrangement of petals in a sunflower, or the holes in a honeycomb[cite: 638]. In mathematics, we formalize these patterns into **Sequences**.\n\n#### 1.1 What is a Sequence?\nA sequence is an ordered list of numbers following a specific rule. Each number in the sequence is called a **term**.\n* **Example:** 1, 2, 3, 4... (Natural numbers)\n* **Example:** 100, 70, 40, 10... (Decreasing pattern) [cite: 683]\n* **Example:** 2, 4, 8, 16... (Multiplicative pattern)\n\n#### 1.2 Definition of Arithmetic Progression (AP)\nAn **Arithmetic Progression** is a specific type of sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the **Common Difference** ($d$) [cite: 701-702].\n\n**Formal Definition:**\nA sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots, a_n, \\dots$ is an Arithmetic Progression if there exists a constant $d$ such that:\n$$a_{k+1} - a_k = d$$\nfor all natural numbers $k$.\n\n* **First Term ($a$):** The starting point of the sequence ($a_1$).\n* **Common Difference ($d$):** The fixed number added to the preceding term to get the next term[cite: 701]. It can be positive, negative, or zero[cite: 702].\n\n#### 1.3 Types of APs\n1.  **Finite AP:** An AP with a limited number of terms. It has a distinct **last term** ($l$) [cite: 721-722].\n    * *Example:* Heights of students in a line: 147, 148, ..., 157[cite: 709].\n2.  **Infinite AP:** An AP that continues indefinitely. It has no last term [cite: 723-724].\n    * *Example:* 1, 2, 3, 4, ... [cite: 682].\n\n#### 1.4 General Form of an AP\nIf the first term is $a$ and the common difference is $d$, the AP can be written as:\n$$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \\dots$$\nThis represents the structure of every possible arithmetic progression [cite: 718-720].\n\n#### 1.5 Identifying an AP\nTo check if a list of numbers is an AP, calculate the difference between consecutive terms ($a_2 - a_1$, $a_3 - a_2$, etc.). If these differences are all equal, the list is an AP [cite: 761-762].\n\n* **List:** 6, 9, 12, 15\n    * $9 - 6 = 3$\n    * $12 - 9 = 3$\n    * $15 - 12 = 3$\n    * Since differences are constant ($d=3$), it is an AP [cite: 757-762].\n* **List:** 1, 1, 2, 3, 5\n    * $1 - 1 = 0$\n    * $2 - 1 = 1$\n    * Differences are not constant. Not an AP[cite: 775].",

Two figures are congruent if they have the *same shape* and the *same size*. You can superimpose one on the other perfectly.\n\nBut the real world is rarely about identical copies. It is about **Scaling**. \n* A photograph of the Taj Mahal is a small-scale model of the actual monument.\n* A map of India represents the country reduced by a constant factor.\n* An architect's blueprint represents a massive building on a sheet of paper.\n\nIn these cases, the *shape* remains the same, but the *size* changes. This concept is called **Similarity**.\n\n#### 1.1 Formal Definition\nTwo geometric figures are **Similar** if:\n1.  They have the same **shape**.\n2.  They do not necessarily have the same size.\n\n**Polygons:**\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar if:\n1.  Their **corresponding angles** are equal (Equiangular).\n2.  Their **corresponding sides** are in the same ratio (or proportion).\n\n* **Example 1 (Equilateral Triangles):** All equilateral triangles are similar. Their angles are always $60^\\circ$. The ratio of sides will always be constant ($a_1/a_2$).\n* **Example 2 (Circles):** All circles are similar. They only differ by radius.\n* **Example 3 (Squares):** All squares are similar. Angles are $90^\\circ$, and side ratios are constant.\n\n**Non-Example:** Consider a Square and a Rectangle. Corresponding angles are equal ($90^\\circ$), but corresponding sides are not proportional (Square has 1:1 ratio, Rectangle has length:width ratio). They are not similar.\n**Non-Example:** Consider a Square and a Rhombus. Corresponding sides are proportional (1:1), but corresponding angles are different. They are not similar.\n\n**Conclusion:** For similarity of polygons, **BOTH** conditions (angle equality and side proportionality) must be met.",

            "content": "### 3. Proving Similarity\nJust as we had SAS, SSS, ASA for congruence, we have criteria for similarity. Remember: Congruence is a special case of Similarity where the scaling factor is 1.\n\n#### 3.1 AAA Similarity Criterion (Angle-Angle-Angle)\n**Theorem 6.3:** If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (proportional) and hence the two triangles are similar.\n\n**Given:** $\\Delta ABC$ and $\\Delta DEF$ such that $\\angle A = \\angle D, \\angle B = \\angle E, \\angle C = \\angle F$.\n**Proof Strategy:** We \"cut\" the larger triangle to make a congruent copy of the smaller one on top, then use BPT.\n1.  Cut $DP = AB$ and $DQ = AC$ on sides $DE$ and $DF$.\n2.  $\\Delta ABC \\cong \\Delta DPQ$ (SAS Congruence, as angles are equal and sides cut to be equal).\n3.  $\\angle ABC = \\angle DPQ$ (CPCT).\n4.  But $\\angle ABC = \\angle DEF$ (Given).\n5.  So $\\angle DPQ = \\angle DEF$. These are corresponding angles.\n6.  Therefore, $PQ || EF$.\n7.  By BPT on $\\Delta DEF$: $\\frac{DP}{DE} = \\frac{DQ}{DF}$.\n8.  Replace $DP, DQ$ with $AB, AC$: $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{AC}{DF}$.\n9.  Similarly, we can prove $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{BC}{EF}$. Hence Proved.\n\n**AA Similarity:** Since sum of angles is $180^\\circ$, if two angles are equal, the third *must* be equal. So, finding 2 pairs of equal angles is sufficient to prove similarity.\n\n#### 3.2 SSS Similarity Criterion (Side-Side-Side)\n**Theorem 6.4:** If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similar.\n**Statement:** If $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{BC}{EF} = \\frac{AC}{DF}$, then $\\Delta ABC \\sim \\Delta DEF$.\n**Proof:** Similar construction (cut $DP=AB, DQ=AC$) and use converse of BPT.\n\n#### 3.3 SAS Similarity Criterion\n**Theorem 6.5:** If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two triangles are similar.\n**Condition:** $\\frac{AB}{DE} = \\frac{AC}{DF}$ AND $\\angle A = \\angle D$.\n\n**Common Mistake:** Just like in congruence, the angle MUST be the **included** angle.

The 17th-century French mathematician René Descartes changed this forever by introducing the **Cartesian Coordinate System**. This system allows us to locate points in a plane using pairs of numbers, thereby turning geometric shapes into algebraic equations and vice versa.\n\n#### 1.1 The Cartesian Plane (Recap)\nRecall from Class IX:\n* Two perpendicular number lines intersect at zero to form the **Origin** $O(0,0)$ [cite: 1].\n* The horizontal line is the **X-axis**.\n* The vertical line is the **Y-axis**.\n* A point $P$ is represented by an ordered pair $(x, y)$.\n    * **Abscissa ($x$):** Perpendicular distance from the y-axis.\n    * **Ordinate ($y$):** Perpendicular distance from the x-axis[cite: 6, 7].\n\n#### 1.2 The Power of Coordinates\nIn this chapter, we move beyond merely plotting points. We will develop algebraic tools to measure geometric properties:\n1.  **Distance:** How far apart are two points?\n2.  **Section:** If a point divides a line segment, what are its coordinates?\n3.  **Geometry of Figures:** Can we prove a figure is a square or a triangle using only numbers?\n\nThis analytical approach is the foundation of modern physics, engineering, computer graphics, and GPS navigation.",

Algebraically, we derive this using the **Pythagoras Theorem**.\n\n#### 2.1 Derivation from First Principles\nLet there be two points $P(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2)$ in the Cartesian plane.\n\n**Construction:**\n1.  Draw perpendiculars $PM$ and $QN$ to the x-axis.\n2.  Draw a perpendicular $PT$ from $P$ to $QN$[cite: 105].\n\n**Analysis of Coordinates:**\n* $OR = x_1$ and $OS = x_2$. Therefore, $RS = OS - OR = x_2 - x_1$. Since $PT = RS$, we have $PT = x_2 - x_1$.\n* $SQ = y_2$ and $ST = PM = y_1$. Therefore, $QT = SQ - ST = y_2 - y_1$ [cite: 106].\n\n**Applying Pythagoras Theorem:**\nIn the right-angled triangle $\\Delta PTQ$:\n$$PQ^2 = PT^2 + QT^2$$\n$$PQ^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2$$ [cite: 108, 109].\n\nTaking the square root (distance is non-negative):\n$$PQ = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nThis is the **Distance Formula**.\n\n#### 2.2 Distance from Origin\nA special case arises when one point is the origin $O(0, 0)$ and the other is $P(x, y)$.\nSubstituting $x_1=0, y_1=0$ into the formula:\n$$OP = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$[cite: 128].\n\n#### 2.3 Properties of the Distance Formula\n1.  **Symmetry:** $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2}$ because squaring eliminates the negative sign. The order of points does not matter[cite: 129].\n2.  **Non-negativity:** Distance is always $\\ge 0$[cite: 119].\n3.  **Horizontal/Vertical Lines:**\n    * If $y_1 = y_2$ (Horizontal line), Distance $= |x_2 - x_1|$.\n    * If $x_1 = x_2$ (Vertical line), Distance $= |y_2 - y_1|$.",

Draw $AQ \\perp PS$ and $PC \\perp BT$ [cite: 314].\n\n**Similarity Argument:**\nTriangles $\\Delta PAQ$ and $\\Delta BPC$ are similar by AA similarity:\n* $\\angle PAQ = \\angle BPC$ (Corresponding angles).\n* $\\angle PQA = \\angle PCB = 90^\\circ$.\n\n**Ratio of Sides:**\n$\\frac{PA}{BP} = \\frac{AQ}{PC} = \\frac{PQ}{BC}$ [cite: 320].\n\n**Substituting Coordinates:**\n* $AQ = x - x_1$\n* $PC = x_2 - x$\n* $PQ = y - y_1$\n* $BC = y_2 - y$ [cite: 321, 322].\n\nSo, $\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x} = \\frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y}$ [cite: 326].\n\n**Solving for x:**\n$\\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x} \\implies m_1(x_2 - x) = m_2(x - x_1)$\n$m_1x_2 - m_1x = m_2x - m_2x_1$\n$m_1x_2 + m_2x_1 = m_1x + m_2x$\n$x(m_1 + m_2) = m_1x_2 + m_2x_1$\n$$x = \\frac{m_1x_2 + m_2x_1}{m_1 + m_2}$$ [cite: 328].\n\n**Solving for y:**\nSimilarly, $$y = \\frac{m_1y_2 + m_2y_1}{m_1 + m_2}$$[cite: 329].\n\nThis is the **Section Formula**.\n\n#### 4.2 The k:1 Method\nWhen the ratio is unknown, it is often algebraically simpler to assume the ratio is $k:1$. The formula becomes:\n$$x = \\frac{kx_2 + x_1}{k + 1}, \\quad y = \\frac{ky_2 + y_1}{k + 1}$$[cite: 335, 337].\nIf the calculated $k$ is positive, the division is internal. If $k$ is negative, the division is external.\n\n#### 4.3 Midpoint Formula\nIf $P$ is the midpoint, the ratio is $1:1$ ($m_1 = 1, m_2 = 1$).\n$$P(x, y) = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)$$[cite: 338, 339].",

Solving Complex Geometric Problems\nThe section formula is a powerful tool for solving problems involving trisection, parallelograms, and centroids.\n\n#### 5.1 Points of Trisection\nTrisection means dividing a segment into **three equal parts**. This requires two points, say $P$ and $Q$, on segment $AB$.\n* Point $P$ divides $AB$ in the ratio **1:2** (since $AP$ is 1 part and $PB$ is 2 parts).\n* Point $Q$ divides $AB$ in the ratio **2:1** (since $AQ$ is 2 parts and $QB$ is 1 part)[cite: 389].\n\n#### 5.2 Finding the Fourth Vertex of a Parallelogram\nIf three vertices $A, B, C$ of a parallelogram $ABCD$ are given, find $D(x, y)$.\n* **Method:** The diagonals of a parallelogram **bisect each other**.\n* Midpoint of $AC$ = Midpoint of $BD$.\n* Calculate midpoint of known diagonal $AC$. Equate it to the formula for midpoint of $BD$ involving $(x, y)$. Solve for $x$ and $y$.\n\n#### 5.3 The Centroid of a Triangle\nThe Centroid ($G$) is the point where the three medians of a triangle intersect. It divides each median in the ratio 2:1.\nFor a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$, the centroid is given by:\n$$G = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} \\right)$$\n(Note: This is an extension derived from applying the section formula twice, first to find the midpoint of a side, then to find the point dividing the median).\n\n#### 5.4 Area of Triangle (Contextual Note)\nWhile the area formula ($0.5 |x_1(y_2-y_3) + ...|$) is standard, one can also determine if points are collinear using the Section Formula. If three points $A, B, C$ are collinear, then $B$ must divide $AC$ in some ratio $k:1$. If you solve for $k$ using x-coordinates and it yields a valid $k$ that *also* works for y-coordinates, the points are collinear.",

            "content": "### 1. The Genesis of Trigonometry\nMathematics often moves from the *static* to the *dynamic*. Geometry, as you have studied it so far (Euclid, Heron), deals with static shapes: triangles, circles, and quadrilaterals with fixed dimensions. \n\n**Trigonometry** (Greek: *trigonon* = triangle, *metron* = measure) is the bridge that connects **Geometry** (shapes) with **Algebra** (numbers/functions). It was born out of a necessity in astronomy—to calculate the distances to stars and planets that could not be physically measured. \n\n#### 1.1 The Fundamental Problem of Measurement\nImagine you are standing on the bank of a wide river. You see a tree on the opposite bank. You want to know the width of the river without crossing it. \n* **Geometry Approach:** You could try to construct congruent triangles on paper, but that requires scaling.\n* **Trigonometry Approach:** You measure the **angle** of your sightline to the top of the tree. This single *angle*, combined with a known *distance* on your side, fixes the entire geometry of the situation.\n\nTrigonometry is based on a profound realization: **In similar triangles, the ratio of sides is fixed by the angles, regardless of the size of the triangle.**\n\n#### 1.2 Angle as Rotation (The Dynamic View)\nIn Euclidean geometry, an angle is the space between two intersecting lines. In Trigonometry, we upgrade this definition.\n* **Ray:** A line with a starting point (vertex).\n* **Rotation:** Imagine a ray starting at an initial position (Initial Side) and rotating about its vertex to a final position (Terminal Side).\n* **The Angle:** The measure of this rotation.\n    * **Positive Angle:** Counter-clockwise rotation.\n    * **Negative Angle:** Clockwise rotation.\n\nWhile Class 10 focuses on acute angles ($0^\\circ \\le \\theta \\le 90^\\circ$), understanding rotation is crucial for Class 11. An angle is not just a shape; it is a **movement**.\n\n#### 1.3 The Right-Angled Triangle Model\nWhy right triangles? Because any polygon can be broken into triangles, and any triangle can be broken into right triangles (by dropping an altitude). The right triangle is the fundamental unit of 2D space.\n\nConsider a right triangle $\\Delta ABC$ with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$. For an acute angle $\\theta$ (at $A$):\n1.  **Hypotenuse ($H$):** The side opposite the right angle ($AC$). It is always the longest side.\n2.  **Opposite Side ($P$ or Perpendicular):** The side facing the angle $\\theta$ ($BC$).

The number of permutations of 2 items from 3 is $^3P_2 = 6$. Hence, there are exactly **six** trigonometric ratios.\n\n#### 2.1 The Primary Ratios\nThese measure the fundamental relationships of the triangle.\n\n1.  **Sine (sin $\\theta$):**\n    * **Definition:** The ratio of the **Opposite** side to the **Hypotenuse**.\n    * **Meaning:** It measures how \"tall\" the triangle is relative to its size.

Since $\\angle A = 45^\\circ$ and $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$, sum of angles implies $\\angle C = 45^\\circ$.\n2.  Therefore, $\\Delta ABC$ is isosceles. $AB = BC$. Let length $= a$.\n3.

They are not magic tricks; they are direct consequences of the **Pythagoras Theorem**.\n\n#### 4.1 The Pythagorean Identities\nConsider right $\\Delta ABC$ with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$.\nBy Pythagoras: $P^2 + B^2 = H^2$.\n\n**Derivation 1 (The Fundamental Identity):**\nDivide the entire equation by $H^2$:\n$$\\frac{P^2}{H^2} + \\frac{B^2}{H^2} = \\frac{H^2}{H^2}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{P}{H}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{B}{H}\\right)^2 = 1$$\n**Result:** $$\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$$\n*Insight:* This is simply the equation of a unit circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$).\n\n**Derivation 2 (The Secant Identity):**\nDivide original equation by $B^2$:\n$$\\frac{P^2}{B^2} + \\frac{B^2}{B^2} = \\frac{H^2}{B^2}$$\n$$\\tan^2 \\theta + 1 = \\sec^2 \\theta$$\n\n**Derivation 3 (The Cosecant Identity):**\nDivide original equation by $P^2$:\n$$\\frac{P^2}{P^2} + \\frac{B^2}{P^2} = \\frac{H^2}{P^2}$$\n$$1 + \\cot^2 \\theta = \\text{cosec}^2 \\theta$$\n\n#### 4.2 Proving Identities: Strategy Guide\nProving `LHS = RHS` is a logical art.\n1.  **Strategy A (Basic):** Convert everything to sine and cosine. This works 90% of the time.\n2.  **Strategy B (Algebraic Identity):** Look for $a^2 - b^2$ or $(a+b)^2$ patterns.\n3.  **Strategy C (Rationalization):** If you see $1 \\pm \\sin \\theta$ in the denominator, multiply by the conjugate ($1 \\mp \\sin \\theta$).\n4.  **Strategy D (LHS & RHS):** Simplify LHS and RHS separately to a common point.\n\n#### 4.3 Complementary Angles (Pre-Class 11)\nWhile deleted in some recent NCERT syllabi, this concept is foundational.\nSince $\\angle A + \\angle C = 90^\\circ$ in a right triangle:\n* $\\sin(90^\\circ - \\theta) = \\cos \\theta$\n* $\\tan(90^\\circ - \\theta) = \\cot \\theta$\n* $\\sec(90^\\circ - \\theta) = \\text{cosec } \\theta$\nThis explains the name \"Cosine\" = \"Sine of the Complement\".",

These are **linear** figures. The circle introduces a fundamental shift: **Curvature**. \n\nCalculating the boundary (perimeter) or the space occupied (area) by a curved figure requires a different mathematical toolset. This chapter bridges the gap between basic geometry and the powerful methods of calculus that you will encounter later.\n\n#### 1.1 The Circle: Definitions Revisited\nA **Circle** is the locus of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance from a fixed point.\n* **Centre ($O$):** The fixed point.\n* **Radius ($r$):** The fixed distance.\n* **Diameter ($d$):** The longest chord passing through the centre ($d = 2r$).\n\n#### 1.2 The Constant $\\pi$ (Pi)\nWhenever we measure the boundary of a circle (Circumference) and divide it by its diameter, we get a constant value, regardless of the size of the circle.\n$$\\frac{\\text{Circumference}}{\\text{Diameter}} = \\pi$$\n\n* **Nature of $\\pi$:** It is an **Irrational Number**. Its decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-recurring ($3.14159\\dots$).\n* **Approximations:** For practical calculations, we often use $\\frac{22}{7}$ or $3.14$. However, these are *not* the exact values of $\\pi$.\n* **Historical Context:** Aryabhata (AD 476–550) gave a very accurate approximation: $62832/20000 = 3.1416$. Srinivasa Ramanujan derived extremely efficient infinite series to calculate $\\pi$.\n\n#### 1.3 Circumference (Perimeter)\nThe distance covered by travelling once around a circle.\nFrom the definition of $\\pi$:\n$$C = \\pi \\times d = \\pi \\times (2r) = 2\\pi r$$\n\n#### 1.4 Area of a Circle: The Intuitive Proof\nWhy is the area $\\pi r^2$? We can visualize this without advanced calculus.\n1.  **Slicing:** Imagine cutting a circle into a large number of equal sectors (like pizza slices).\n2.  **Rearranging:** Arrange these sectors in a row, alternating pointing up and down.\n3.  **Resulting Shape:** As the number of sectors increases towards infinity, the shape resembles a **Rectangle**.\n    * The **Length** of this rectangle is half the circumference (since half the arcs are on top, half on bottom) = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\pi r = \\pi r$.\n    * The **Breadth** (or height) corresponds to the radius = $r$.\n4.  **Calculation:** Area of Rectangle = Length $\\times$ Breadth = $(\\pi r) \\times r = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThus, the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$.",

            "content": "### 2. Slicing the Circle: Sectors and Segments\nUsually, we don't deal with full circles, but parts of them. We must distinguish between two types of \"slices\".\n\n#### 2.1 Sector of a Circle\nA **Sector** is the region enclosed by two radii and the corresponding arc.\n* **Minor Sector:** The smaller slice (angle $\\theta < 180^\\circ$).\n* **Major Sector:** The larger slice (angle $360^\\circ - \\theta$).\n* **Central Angle ($\\\\theta$):** The angle subtended by the arc at the centre.\n\n**Deriving Area of Sector:**\nWe use the **Unitary Method** based on angles.\n* Area of the complete circle (angle $360^\\circ$) is $\\pi r^2$.\n* Area corresponding to $1^\\circ$ is $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{360}$.\n* Therefore, area corresponding to angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$A_{\\text{sector}} = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2$$\n\n**Deriving Length of Arc:**\nSimilarly, the total length of the circle is $2\\pi r$.\n* Length of arc corresponding to angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$L_{\\text{arc}} = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times 2\\pi r$$\n\n#### 2.2 Segment of a Circle\nA **Segment** is the region bounded by a **Chord** and the corresponding **Arc**.\n* **Minor Segment:** Enclosed by the chord and the minor arc.\n* **Major Segment:** Enclosed by the chord and the major arc.\n\n**Deriving Area of Segment:**\nThere is no direct formula for a segment based purely on $\\theta$ and $r$. We must decompose the figure.\n* Visualize the Sector containing the segment.\n* The Sector is composed of the **Segment** plus the **Triangle** formed by the two radii and the chord.\n* Therefore:\n$$\\text{Area of Segment} = \\text{Area of Sector} - \\text{Area of Triangle}$$\n$$A_{\\text{segment}} = \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times \\pi r^2 \\right) - \\text{Area}(\\Delta OAB)$$\n\n#### 2.3 Area of Triangle $\\Delta OAB$\nFinding the area of the central triangle is the tricky part. We drop a perpendicular $OM$ to the chord $AB$.\n* Base of triangle = $AB$.\n* Height of triangle = $OM$.\n* Using trigonometry in $\\Delta OMA$ and $\\Delta OMB$:\n    * $AB = 2r \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    * $OM = r \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    * Area $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{2} (2r \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}) (r \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}) = r^2 \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\n    * Using the identity $\\sin \\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$, this simplifies to:\n    $$\\text{Area}(\\Delta OAB) = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\sin \\theta$$\n    *(Note: For Class 10, calculating height and base manually for standard angles $60^\\circ, 90^\\circ$ is preferred over memorizing the sine formula directly, though the result is valid.)*\n\n**Special Cases:**\n* **$\\theta = 90^\\circ$:** Triangle is right-angled. Area $= \\frac{1}{2} r^2$.\n* **$\\theta = 60^\\circ$:** Triangle is equilateral. Area $= \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2$.",

They occupy space and have surfaces.\n\nIn Class 9, you were introduced to basic solids. In Class 10, we move to **Composite Solids**—combinations of basic shapes. To solve these problems, you must first master the art of decomposition: breaking a complex object into simple parts.\n\n#### 1.1 Surface Area vs Volume\nThis distinction is crucial and often confused.\n1.  **Surface Area:** Imagine you want to **paint** the object or wrap it in **gift paper**. The amount of paint or paper required depends on the area of the boundaries (faces). It is a 2D measure of the \"skin\" of the object.\n    * **Unit:** Square units ($cm^2, m^2$).\n2.  **Volume:** Imagine you want to **fill** the object with water or sand. The amount it can hold (capacity) or the space it occupies is Volume. It is a 3D measure of the \"body\" of the object.\n    * **Unit:** Cubic units ($cm^3, m^3$).\n\n#### 1.2 Types of Surface Area\n* **Curved Surface Area (CSA):** Also called Lateral Surface Area. This is the area of the \"curved\" part only, excluding the flat top and bottom bases. Used for open pipes, tents, etc.\n* **Total Surface Area (TSA):** CSA + Area of Top Base + Area of Bottom Base. Used for closed containers, solid blocks, etc.",

            "content": "### 1. Introduction: Why Statistics Matters\nWe live in an information age. Every day, we encounter a barrage of numbers: the average temperature of the month, the strike rate of a cricket player, the inflation rate of the economy, or the polling numbers for an election. These numbers are not just random figures; they are **Data**.\n\nHowever, data in its raw form is often chaotic and meaningless. A list of the heights of 1,000 students is just a wall of numbers. To make sense of it, we need a method to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret this data. This mathematical science is called **Statistics**.\n\nIn Class 9, you learned to organize data into ungrouped frequency distributions and draw bar graphs. In Class 10, we step into the analytical phase. We move from asking \"What is the data?\" to asking \"What does the data represent?\" and \"Where is the center of the data?\"\n\n#### 1.1 Raw Data vs. Grouped Data\nTo understand the necessity of the methods we will learn, consider two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario A: Raw Data (Ungrouped)**\nA teacher asks 5 students for their marks out of 10: \n`5, 7, 9, 6, 8`.\nHere, the data points are few. We can easily see that the lowest is 5 and the highest is 9. We can calculate the average mentally.\n\n**Scenario B: Large Data**\nThe government wants to analyze the monthly income of 50,000 families in a city. A list of 50,000 numbers is useless to a human reader. To interpret this, we must **group** the data. We might say:\n* Families earning ₹10,000 – ₹20,000: 5,000 families\n* Families earning ₹20,000 – ₹30,000: 12,000 families\n\nThis process is called **discretization** or grouping. While grouping makes data manageable, it introduces a challenge: *We lose the exact values of individual observations.* We only know that a family earns between ₹10,000 and ₹20,000; we don't know if it's ₹10,001 or ₹19,999. \n\nThis chapter teaches us how to find accurate averages (Central Tendency) even when the exact individual data points are hidden inside groups.\n\n#### 1.2 Anatomy of a Frequency Distribution Table\nBefore calculating, we must understand the structure of the table we work with.\n\n1.  **Class Interval:** A range of values (e.g., 10 – 20). \n    * **Lower Class Limit ($l$):** The smallest value in the class (e.g., 10).\n    * **Upper Class Limit ($u$):** The largest value in the class (e.g., 20).\n    * **Class Size ($h$):** The difference between the upper and lower limits ($h = u - l$).\n\n2.  **Frequency ($f_i$):** The number of observations that fall within a specific class interval.\n\n3.  **Class Mark ($x_i$):** This is a crucial concept for calculation. Since we don't know the exact values inside a class (e.g., 10–20), we assume that the data is centered at the midpoint. \n    $$x_i = \\frac{\\text{Upper Limit} + \\text{Lower Limit}}{2}$$\n    We treat $x_i$ as the representative of the entire class.\n\n4.  **Continuous vs. Discontinuous Classes:**\n    * **Continuous (Exclusive):** 0–10, 10–20. The upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the next. (10 is included in 10–20, not 0–10).\n    * **Discontinuous (Inclusive):** 0–9, 10–19. There is a gap between 9 and 10. \n    * **Correction:** Most statistical formulas require continuous classes. If given discontinuous classes, we subtract 0.5 from the lower limit and add 0.5 to the upper limit to bridge the gap.",

            "title": "13.2 The Arithmetic Mean: Finding the Balance Point",
            "content": "### 2. The Mean ($\\\\bar{x}$)\nThe Mean is the most common measure of central tendency. It represents the \"center of gravity\" or the \"balance point\" of the data. If the total sum of all observations were distributed equally among all individuals, the value each would receive is the Mean.\n\nFor ungrouped data, Mean = $\\frac{\\sum x_i}{N}$.\nFor grouped data, we use the class marks ($x_i$) as representatives. However, calculating $\\sum f_i x_i$ can become computationally difficult if the numbers are large. Therefore, mathematicians developed three methods to calculate the mean. All three yield the **exact same result**; the difference lies only in the complexity of calculation.\n\n#### 2.1 Method 1: Direct Method\nThis is the definition of the weighted average.\n1.  Find the Class Mark ($x_i$) for each interval.\n2.  Multiply the frequency ($f_i$) by the class mark ($x_i$) to get $f_i x_i$.\n3.  Sum the products ($\\sum f_i x_i$).\n4.  Sum the frequencies ($\\sum f_i$).\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum f_i x_i}{\\sum f_i}$$\n\n* **When to use:** When the values of $x_i$ and $f_i$ are small, and multiplication is easy.\n* **Drawback:** If $x_i = 1452.5$ and $f_i = 25$, multiplication becomes prone to error.\n\n#### 2.2 Method 2: Assumed Mean Method\nTo handle large numbers, we shift the origin. We pick a central class mark and call it the **Assumed Mean ($a$)**. We then measure how far other values deviate from this anchor.\n\n1.  Choose a value $a$ from the $x_i$ column (usually the middle one).\n2.  Calculate the **Deviation** ($d_i$) for every row: $d_i = x_i - a$.\n3.  Multiply $f_i$ by $d_i$ to get $f_i d_i$.\n4.  Find the mean of deviations: $\\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum f_i d_i}{\\sum f_i}$.\n5.  Add the assumed mean back to get the true mean.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\bar{x} = a + \\frac{\\sum f_i d_i}{\\sum f_i}$$\n\n* **Logic:** If you subtract $a$ from every number, the average decreases by $a$. To fix it, we calculate the average of the remainders (deviations) and add $a$ back.\n\n#### 2.3 Method 3: Step-Deviation Method\nIf the deviations ($d_i$) are still large but share a common factor (usually the class size $h$), we can scale them down further. This involves changing both the origin and the scale.\n\n1.  Calculate $d_i = x_i - a$.\n2.  Divide $d_i$ by the class size $h$ to get $u_i = \\frac{x_i - a}{h}$.\n3.  Multiply $f_i$ by $u_i$.\n4.  The formula adjusts for both the subtraction of $a$ and the division by $h$.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\bar{x} = a + \\left( \\frac{\\sum f_i u_i}{\\sum f_i} \\right) \\times h$$\n\n* **When to use:** When class sizes are equal and the deviations are multiples of $h$. This makes calculations trivial (often single-digit numbers).\n\n#### 2.4 Interpretation of Mean\nThe mean is sensitive to **extreme values (outliers)**. \n* *Example:* If 5 people earn ₹100, and one person earns ₹1,000,000, the mean income will be huge, suggesting everyone is rich. This is a flaw of the mean. However, for relatively uniform data (like heights of students), the mean is the most accurate summary.",

In a voting system, the winner is the candidate who gets the *mode* of the votes.\n\n#### 3.1 Understanding Mode for Grouped Data\nIn ungrouped data (e.g., 2, 4, 2, 5, 2), the mode is simply 2 because it appears most often. \nHowever, in grouped data, we cannot see individual frequencies. We only see a class interval with the highest frequency. This interval is called the **Modal Class**.\n\n* **Conceptual Challenge:** Suppose the Modal Class is 20–30 with a frequency of 50. The mode is definitely inside this interval. But is it 21? 25? 29? \n* **The Logic of Interpolation:** The exact position of the mode inside the class depends on the \"pull\" of the neighboring frequencies.\n    * If the frequency of the *previous* class is high, the mode shifts towards the left (closer to 20).\n    * If the frequency of the *next* class is high, the mode shifts towards the right (closer to 30).\n\n#### 3.2 The Formula\nThe formula calculates this exact balance point within the modal class:\n\n$$ \\text{Mode} = l + \\left( \\frac{f_1 - f_0}{2f_1 - f_0 - f_2} \\right) \\times h $$\n\nWhere:\n* $l$ = Lower limit of the **Modal Class** (the class with max frequency).\n* $h$ = Class size.\n* $f_1$ = Frequency of the **Modal Class**.\n* $f_0$ = Frequency of the class **preceding** (before) the modal class.\n* $f_2$ = Frequency of the class **succeeding** (after) the modal class.\n\n* **Interpretation of the term $(f_1 - f_0)$:** This measures how much the peak rises above the previous value.\n* **Interpretation of the denominator:** This normalizes the position based on both neighbors.\n\n#### 3.3 Important Note on Unimodal Data\nThis formula applies to data with a single distinct peak. If a distribution has two classes with the same maximum frequency (Bimodal), this basic formula requires modification (not in Class 10 scope).",

It divides the distribution into two equal halves: 50% of observations lie below the median, and 50% lie above it.\n\nUnlike the Mean, the Median is **Robust**. It is not easily influenced by outliers. If the richest person walks into a room of middle-class people, the Mean income skyrockets, but the Median income barely moves.\n\n#### 4.1 Concept: Cumulative Frequency (cf)\nTo find the \"middle\" person, we can't just look at individual buckets of data. We need a running total. \n* **Frequency ($f$):** How many in *this* group?\n* **Cumulative Frequency ($cf$):** How many in *this group and all previous groups*?\n\nThis tells us the **rank** or **position** of the data up to that point.\n\n#### 4.2 Locating the Median Class\n1.  Calculate the total number of observations, $N = \\sum f_i$.\n2.  Find the position of the middle item: $N/2$.\n3.  Look at the Cumulative Frequency ($cf$) column. Find the first class where $cf \\ge N/2$. This class contains the middle item. This is the **Median Class**.\n\n#### 4.3 The Formula Explained\nOnce we have the Median Class (say, 20–30), we know the median lies inside it. But where? We assume the data is uniformly distributed within this class.\n\n$$ \\text{Median} = l + \\left( \\frac{\\frac{N}{2} - cf}{f} \\right) \\times h $$\n\nWhere:\n* $l$ = Lower limit of the Median Class.\n* $N$ = Total number of observations.\n* $cf$ = Cumulative frequency of the class **preceding** the median class (How many items did we pass *before* entering this class?).\n* $f$ = Frequency of the Median Class (How many items are *in* this class?).\n* $h$ = Class size.\n\n**The Logic:**\n1.  We need to reach rank $N/2$.\n2.  We have already passed $cf$ items (from previous classes).\n3.  We still need to pass $(N/2 - cf)$ items.\n4.  The current class has $f$ items spread over a width $h$.\n5.  So, we travel a fraction $(N/2 - cf)/f$ of the width $h$ into the class.\n\n",

Seeing the Trends: Cumulative Frequency Curves\nWhile histograms show the frequency of each class, they don't easily tell us \"How many students scored *less than* 50?\". For this, we use the Cumulative Frequency Curve, also known as the **Ogive** (pronounced 'oh-jive').\n\nThere are two types of Ogives, which tell the story of the data from opposite ends.\n\n#### 5.1 Less Than Ogive\nThis graph answers questions like: \"How many items are below value X?\"\n* **X-axis:** Use the **Upper Limits** of the class intervals.\n* **Y-axis:** Use the corresponding **Cumulative Frequencies**.\n* **Shape:** It is an increasing curve (rising upwards).\n* **Logic:** At the upper limit of a class (say 20), the cumulative frequency includes everything in that class and below. Hence, we plot (Upper Limit, cf).\n\n#### 5.2 More Than Ogive\nThis graph answers questions like: \"How many items are above value X?\"\n* **X-axis:** Use the **Lower Limits** of the class intervals.\n* **Y-axis:** Use the **Cumulative Frequencies** (accumulated from the bottom up, or Total - Previous cf).\n* **Shape:** It is a decreasing curve (falling downwards).\n* **Logic:** At the lower limit of the first class (say 0), *all* observations are \"more than or equal to\" 0. So we start at Total N and drop down.\n\n#### 5.3 Finding Median Graphically\nThe Ogive gives us a powerful geometric way to find the Median without calculation.\n\n**Method 1: Using One Ogive (Less Than)**\n1.  Draw the Less Than Ogive.\n2.  Locate $N/2$ on the **Y-axis** (Frequency axis).\n3.  Draw a horizontal line from $N/2$ until it hits the curve.\n4.  From that intersection point, drop a vertical line to the **X-axis**.\n5.  The value on the X-axis is the **Median**.\n\n**Method 2: Intersection of Two Ogives**\n1.  Draw both the 'Less Than' and 'More Than' Ogives on the same graph.\n2.  They will intersect at exactly one point.\n3.  The **X-coordinate (Abscissa)** of this intersection point is the Median.\n\n",

            "title": "14.1 Introduction: The Mathematics of Uncertainty",
            "content": "### 1. Introduction: Quantifying the Unknown\nLife is full of uncertainties. We often ask questions like: \"Will it rain today?\", \"Who will win the match?\", or \"Will I get a head if I toss this coin?\" The answers to these questions are not definite. There is a chance that it will rain, and there is a chance that it will not.\n\nIn mathematics, we do not like ambiguity. We prefer precise numbers. **Probability** is the branch of mathematics that attempts to measure uncertainty. It converts vague terms like \"likely,\" \"maybe,\" \"probably,\" and \"doubtful\" into precise numerical values.\n\nHistorically, the theory of probability originated from games of chance (gambling) in the 17th century, where players wanted to know their chances of winning. Today, it is the backbone of science, economics, genetics, weather forecasting, and artificial intelligence.\n\n#### 1.1 The Concept of Randomness\nBefore calculating probability, we must understand the environment in which it operates. Probability applies only to **Random Experiments**.\n\n**Definition: Experiment**\nAn operation which can produce some well-defined outcomes is called an experiment.\n\n**Definition: Random Experiment**\nAn experiment is called random if:\n1.  It has more than one possible outcome.\n2.  It is impossible to predict the exact outcome in advance.\n\n**Examples:**\n* *Tossing a coin:* We know it will be Head or Tail, but we cannot predict which one it will be in a specific toss. This is a random experiment.\n* *Measuring the length of a table:* If you measure it ten times, you get the same result (ignoring measurement error). This is **deterministic**, not random.\n* *Rolling a die:* We know the result will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We cannot say which specific number will show up. This is random.\n\n#### 1.2 The Sample Space and Events\nTo analyze a random experiment, we first list everything that *could* happen.\n\n**1. Outcome:**\nA possible result of a random experiment.\n* *Example:* In tossing a coin, 'Head' is an outcome.\n\n**2. Sample Space ($S$):**\nThe set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.\n* *Symbol:* Usually denoted by $S$.\n* *Example (Coin Toss):* $S = \\{Head, Tail\\}$.\n* *Example (Die Roll):* $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n**3. Event ($E$):**\nAny subset of the sample space is called an event. An event represents a specific condition we are interested in.\n* *Example:* In rolling a die, let $E$ be the event \"Getting an even number\".\n    * Outcomes favorable to $E$: $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$.\n    * Since $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ is a part of the Sample Space $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, it is an event.\n\n#### 1.3 Equally Likely Outcomes\nThis is the most critical assumption in Class 10 Probability. \n\nWhen we toss a coin, we assume the coin is **fair** (or unbiased). This means it is perfectly symmetrical and uniform. There is no physical reason for it to land on one side more often than the other. Therefore, we say the outcomes 'Head' and 'Tail' are **equally likely**.\n\nSimilarly, when rolling a standard die, we assume it is unbiased. Each face (1 to 6) has an equal chance of appearing.\n\n**Contrast:** Suppose you have a bag with 4 Red balls and 1 Blue ball. If you pick a ball without looking, the outcome \"Red\" is *more likely* than \"Blue\". These outcomes are **not** equally likely. However, picking any *specific* individual ball is equally likely. \n\n**Why is this important?**\nThe standard formula for probability (see below) only works if all elementary outcomes are equally likely.",

            "title": "14.2 Theoretical Probability (Classical Definition)",
            "content": "### 2. The Definition of Probability\nThere are two main approaches to probability:\n1.  **Experimental (Empirical) Probability:** Based on actual trials. (e.g., Tossing a coin 1000 times and counting heads). This was covered in Class 9.\n2.  **Theoretical (Classical) Probability:** Based on logic and the assumption of equally likely outcomes. This is the focus of Class 10.\n\n#### 2.1 The Formula\nFor an event $E$ associated with a random experiment where all outcomes are equally likely, the theoretical probability of the event $E$, denoted by $P(E)$, is defined as:\n\n$$ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes favorable to } E}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} $$\n\n**Let's break this down:**\n* **Total number of possible outcomes:** This is the size of the Sample Space ($|S|$).\n* **Number of outcomes favorable to E:** This is the count of outcomes that satisfy the condition of the event.\n* **Ratio:** Probability is always a ratio (fraction). It represents the *proportion* of the total possibilities that lead to success.\n\n#### 2.2 Range of Probability\nSince the number of favorable outcomes can never be negative and can never exceed the total number of outcomes:\n1.  The numerator is always $\\ge 0$.\n2.  The numerator is always $\\le$ the denominator.\n\nTherefore:\n$$ 0 \\le P(E) \\le 1 $$\n\n* **P(E) = 0:** The event is **Impossible**. (e.g., Rolling a 7 on a standard die).\n* **P(E) = 1:** The event is **Sure** or **Certain**. (e.g., Rolling a number less than 7 on a standard die).\n\n**Important:**\n* Probability can never be negative.\n* Probability can never be greater than 1 (e.g., 1.5 or 110% is impossible).\n\n#### 2.3 Elementary vs. Compound Events\n* **Elementary Event:** An event having only one outcome of the experiment. \n    * *Example:* In tossing a coin, getting Head $\\{H\\}$ is an elementary event.\n    * *Property:* The sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1.\n* **Compound Event:** An event that has more than one outcome.\n    * *Example:* In rolling a die, getting an Even number $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ is a compound event because it contains three elementary outcomes.\n\n#### 2.4 Complementary Events\nFor any event $E$, there exists an event \"Not E\" (denoted as $\\bar{E}$ or $E'$). This event occurs whenever $E$ does *not* occur.\n\nSince an outcome must either be in $E$ or not in $E$:\n$$ P(E) + P(\\text{not } E) = 1 $$\n$$ P(\\bar{E}) = 1 - P(E) $$\n\nThis formula is extremely useful. Sometimes it is difficult to calculate $P(E)$ directly, but easy to calculate $P(\\bar{E})$. We calculate the \"not\" case and subtract from 1.",

Two Coins Tossed Simultaneously:**\n* This is the same as tossing one coin twice.\n* Outcomes: $\\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$.\n* Total = $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n* *Note:* HT means Head on first, Tail on second.

Here are the most common pitfalls students fall into.\n\n#### 4.1 The Error of \"At Least\" and \"At Most\"\nStudents often confuse these terms in coin problems.\n* **At least 1 Head:** Means 1 Head OR MORE. (1 or 2 heads in 2 coin toss).\n    * Outcomes: HT, TH, HH. (Count = 3).\n* **At most 1 Head:** Means 1 Head OR LESS. (1 or 0 heads).\n    * Outcomes: HT, TH, TT. (Count = 3).\n* *Mistake:* Forgetting the 0 case in \"At most\" or the maximum case in \"At least\".\n\n#### 4.2 The Error of \"Or\" vs \"And\"\nIn probability logic:\n* **OR** usually means Addition (Union). \"King OR Queen\" means you count all Kings and all Queens.\n* **AND** usually means Multiplication/Intersection. \"King AND Red\" means you only count cards that are *both* Kings and Red.\n\n#### 4.3 The \"Three Options\" Fallacy\n*Question:* \"I toss two coins. I can get 0 Heads, 1 Head, or 2 Heads. Therefore, the probability of getting 1 Head is 1/3.\"\n\n**WHY THIS IS WRONG:**\nThe outcomes (0 Heads, 1 Head, 2 Heads) are **NOT equally likely**.\n* 0 Heads = {TT} (1 outcome)\n* 1 Head = {HT, TH} (2 outcomes)\n* 2 Heads = {HH} (1 outcome)\nTotal elementary outcomes = 4.\n* P(0 Heads) = 1/4\n* P(1 Head) = 2/4 = 1/2\n* P(2 Heads) = 1/4\nThe probability is 1/2, not 1/3. Never group outcomes unless the groups are equal in size.\n\n#### 4.4 Ignoring Order in Dice\n*Question:* Two dice are rolled. Probability of getting a 2 and a 3.\n*Mistake:* Counting only (2, 3).\n*Correction:* You must count (2, 3) AND (3, 2). The dice are distinct entities (mathematically distinct even if they look identical).",

The Foundation of Mathematics\n\n**\"No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created.\"** — *David Hilbert*\n\nThe theory of sets is the bedrock upon which all of modern mathematics rests. Whether we are discussing sequences, probability, calculus functions, or geometric points, we are ultimately discussing **sets** of objects. \n\nDeveloped by the German mathematician **Georg Cantor (1845-1918)** while working on trigonometric series, set theory provides the rigorous logical framework to define collections of objects.\n\n### 2. Definition of a Set\n\nA **set** is a **well-defined collection of distinct objects**.\n\n#### What does \"Well-Defined\" mean?\nA collection is well-defined if there is a clear, unambiguous rule to decide whether a particular object belongs to the collection or not. There must be no subjectivity.\n\n**Examples of Well-Defined Sets:**\n* The collection of all vowels in the English alphabet: $V = \\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$. (Rule is absolute)\n* The collection of roots of the equation $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. (Rule is mathematical)\n* The collection of all rivers in India. (Geographically defined)\n\n**Examples of Not Well-Defined Collections (NOT Sets):**\n* *The collection of \"good\" cricket players.* (Subjective: \"Good\" is matter of opinion)\n* *The collection of \"difficult\" problems in mathematics.* (Subjective)\n* *The collection of \"large\" numbers.* (Undefined boundary)\n\n### 3. Notation\n* Sets are usually denoted by **capital letters**: $A, B, C, X, Y, Z$.\n* Elements (or members) are denoted by **small letters**: $a, b, c, x, y, z$.\n* **Membership Symbol ($∈$):**\n    * If $a$ is an element of set $A$, we write **$a \\in A$** (read as \"$a$ belongs to $A$\").\n    * If $b$ is *not* an element of set $A$, we write **$b \\notin A$** (read as \"$b$ does not belong to $A$\").",

Here $A = B$.\n\n### 5. Equivalent Sets\nTwo finite sets $A$ and $B$ are equivalent if they have the **same number of elements**, i.e., same cardinality.\n$$ n(A) = n(B) $$\n* Equal sets are always equivalent, but equivalent sets need not be equal.\n* Example: $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, $B = \\{a, b, c\\}$. $n(A)=n(B)=3$, so they are equivalent.",

However, in geometry and coordinate systems, **order matters**. The point $(1, 2)$ is distinct from $(2, 1)$.\n\n**Ordered Pair:** An ordered pair consists of two objects listed in a specific order. \n* Notation: $(a, b)$\n* $a$ is the first component, $b$ is the second component.\n\n**Equality of Ordered Pairs:**\nTwo ordered pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are equal **if and only if** their corresponding components are equal.\n$$ (a, b) = (c, d) \\iff a = c \\text{ and } b = d $$\n\n### 2. Cartesian Product ($A \\times B$)\nGiven two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, the Cartesian product $A \\times B$ is the set of **all possible ordered pairs** where the first component comes from $A$ and the second from $B$.\n\n**Definition:**\n$$ A \\times B = \\{ (a, b) : a \\in A, b \\in B \\} $$\n\n**Important Properties:**\n1.  **Non-Commutativity:** Generally, $A \\times B \\neq B \\times A$ (unless $A = B$ or one is empty).\n2.  **Cardinality:** If $n(A) = p$ and $n(B) = q$, then $n(A \\times B) = pq$.\n3.  **Empty Product:** If either $A$ or $B$ is null, $A \\times B = \\phi$.\n4.  **Ordered Triplets:** $A \\times A \\times A = \\{ (a, b, c) : a, b, c \\in A \\}$. This represents 3D space if $A = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### 3.

The sides have lengths $|z_1|, |z_2|, |z_1+z_2|$.\n$$ |z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2| $$\nEquality holds only if $z_1, z_2$ lie on the same ray from origin (i.e., arg($z_1$) = arg($z_2$)).",

Classification of Inequalities\n\n**A. Numerical vs Literal**\n* **Numerical:** $3 < 5$, $7 > 2$. (Fixed truth)\n* **Literal:** $x < 5$, $y \\ge 2$. (Depends on variable)\n\n**B. Strict vs Slack**\n* **Strict Inequality:** Uses $<$ or $>$. The boundary is **excluded**.\n    * Example: $x < 3$ means $x$ can be 2.999... but never 3.\n* **Slack Inequality:** Uses $\\le$ or $\\ge$. The boundary is **included**.\n    * Example: $x \\le 3$ means $x$ can be exactly 3.\n\n**C. Linear vs Quadratic**\n* **Linear Inequality:** The variable has power 1. (e.g., $ax + b < 0$, $ax + by < c$)\n* **Quadratic Inequality:** The variable has power 2.

(Proof by Logic)**\nConsider $2 < 5$.\nMultiply by $-1$.\n* LHS becomes $-2$.\n* RHS becomes $-5$.\nOn the number line, $-5$ is to the left of $-2$.

Express the result in interval notation.\n\n**Important Pitfall: Variables in Denominator**\nNever cross-multiply a variable if you don't know its sign.\n* *Wrong:* $\\frac{1}{x} < 2 \\implies 1 < 2x$ (This assumes $x > 0$).\n* *Correct:* Bring to one side: $\\frac{1}{x} - 2 < 0 \\implies \\frac{1-2x}{x} < 0$. Then use critical point method (Wavy Curve).\n\n### 3. Representation on Number Line\n* **Strict Inequality ($<$ or $>$)**: Use a **hollow circle** (o) at the boundary.\n* **Slack Inequality ($\\le$ or $\\ge$)**: Use a **solid/filled circle** (•) at the boundary.\n* Shade the region satisfying the condition.",

            "content": "### 1. The Art of Counting\nCounting seems trivial—we learn it as toddlers ($1, 2, 3...$). However, the counting required in mathematics and computer science is **Enumerative Combinatorics**: determining the number of ways a complex event can occur without actually listing every possibility.\n\n**Real-Life Examples:**\n* How many distinct passwords can be created using 8 characters?\n* How many ways can a cricket team of 11 be selected from 15 players?\n* How many paths exist from point A to B in a grid?\n\nListing these is impossible. We need **logic**.\n\n### 2. The Fundamental Principle of Counting (FPC)\nThe FPC consists of two core rules: Multiplication and Addition.\n\n#### A. The Multiplication Principle (AND Rule)\nIf an event can occur in $m$ different ways, and following which another event can occur in $n$ different ways, then the total number of occurrences of the events in the given order is $m \\times n$.\n\n**Logic:**\nImagine a tree diagram. You have $m$ branches for the first choice. From *each* of those $m$ branches, $n$ new branches sprout. Total tips = $m \\times n$.\n\n**Example:**\n* 3 distinct shirts and 2 distinct pants.\n* Choice 1 (Shirt): 3 options.\n* Choice 2 (Pant): 2 options.\n* Total Outfits = $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\n#### B. The Addition Principle (OR Rule)\nIf an event can be performed in $m$ ways and another independent event can be performed in $n$ ways, and both cannot occur simultaneously (mutually exclusive), then the total ways to perform **either** of them is $m + n$.\n\n**Example:**\n* You want to travel from Delhi to Mumbai.\n* Options: 3 Flights **OR** 2 Trains.\n* You cannot take both. Total options = $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 3. Common Logical Pitfalls\n* **Overcounting:** Counting the same arrangement twice (e.g., counting $(A, B)$ and $(B, A)$ as different when order doesn't matter).\n* **Undercounting:** Missing specific cases (usually edge cases like zero).\n* **Double Counting:** In \"At least one\" problems, adding overlapping sets without subtracting the intersection (Inclusion-Exclusion).\n\n**Crucial Decision:**\n* Do the tasks happen one after another? $\\to$ **MULTIPLY**\n* Do the tasks happen as alternative choices? $\\to$ **ADD**",

Definition\nTo simplify the product of decreasing natural numbers (like $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$), we define the **Factorial**.\n\nThe factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.\n\n$$ n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times ... \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 $$\n\n### 2. Properties\n1.  **Recursive Definition:** $n! = n \\times (n-1)!$\n    * Example: $5! = 5 \\times 4!$\n2.  **For $n=1$:** $1! = 1$\n3.  **For $n=0$:** $0! = 1$ (A defined convention to make formulas work).\n    * *Proof Logic:* $n! = n(n-1)! \\implies (n-1)! = \\frac{n!}{n}$. Put $n=1$: $0! = \\frac{1!}{1} = 1$.\n4.  **Growth:** Factorials grow extremely fast. $10! = 3,628,800$.\n\n### 3. Calculations with Factorials\nWe rarely multiply them out fully.

The Need for a Theorem\nIn earlier algebra, we memorized identities for small powers:\n* $(a+b)^1 = a+b$\n* $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$\n* $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$\n\nHowever, expanding $(a+b)^{98}$ by repeated multiplication is practically impossible. We need a general formula for $(a+b)^n$. This general rule is the **Binomial Theorem**.\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition (Pascal's Triangle)\nLet's analyze the coefficients of the expansions above:\n* Index 0: `1`\n* Index 1: `1 1`\n* Index 2: `1 2 1`\n* Index 3: `1 3 3 1`\n* Index 4: `1 4 6 4 1`\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  **Triangle Structure:** Arranging these forms a triangle known as **Pascal's Triangle** (Blaise Pascal, 1623-1662), though known earlier in India as **Meru Prastara** (Pingala, 200 BC).\n2.  **Recursive Rule:** Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. (e.g., in Index 4, $6 = 3 + 3$).\n3.  **Connection to Combinations:**\n    * Index 2: $^2C_0, ^2C_1, ^2C_2$ $\\rightarrow$ $1, 2, 1$\n    * Index 3: $^3C_0, ^3C_1, ^3C_2, ^3C_3$ $\\rightarrow$ $1, 3, 3, 1$\n\n**Combinatorial Logic:**\nWhy Combinations? When expanding $(a+b)^n = (a+b)(a+b)...(a+b)$, to get a term like $a^{n-r}b^r$, we must choose '$b$' from exactly $r$ brackets and '$a$' from the remaining $(n-r)$ brackets. The number of ways to choose $r$ brackets out of $n$ is exactly $^nC_r$.",

Unlike a set, order matters, and the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions.\n\n#### Definition as a Function\nFormally, a sequence is defined as a function $f$ whose domain is the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ (or a subset of it) and whose codomain is the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ (for real sequences).\n\n$$ f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R} $$\n\nIf the domain is the set of natural numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, we denote the image of $n$ as $a_n$ instead of $f(n)$.\n\n$$ a_n = f(n) $$\n\nHere, $a_1$ is the first term, $a_2$ is the second term, and $a_n$ is the $n^{th}$ term (also called the general term).\n\n#### Finite vs. Infinite Sequences\n1.  **Finite Sequence:** A sequence containing a finite number of terms. The domain is a finite subset of natural numbers $\\{1, 2, ..., k\\}$.\n    * *Example:* The sequence of digits in the number $\\pi$ up to 5 decimal places: $3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9$.\n2.  **Infinite Sequence:** A sequence that continues indefinitely. The domain is the entire set $\\mathbb{N}$.\n    * *Example:* The sequence of prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...$\n\n### 2. Series\n\nThere is a strict logical distinction between a **sequence** and a **series**.\n\n* **Sequence:** The ordered list $a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n$.\n* **Series:** The indicated sum of the terms of the sequence. It is written as $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_n$.\n\nWe use the Greek letter Sigma ($\\Sigma$) to denote series compactly.\n\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n $$\n\n**Note:** A series is an *expression* of addition. The *value* of the series is the result of that addition.\n\n### 3. Progressions\n\nSequences that follow a specific, predictable mathematical pattern or formula are often called **progressions**. The most fundamental progressions are Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) and Geometric Progression (G.P.).",

            "content": "### 1. Definition\n\nAn **Arithmetic Progression (A.P.)** is a sequence in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant is called the **common difference** ($d$).\n\nLet $a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$ be an A.P. Then:\n$$ a_{n+1} - a_n = d \\quad \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N} $$\n\n* If $d > 0$, the A.P. is increasing.\n* If $d < 0$, the A.P. is decreasing.\n* If $d = 0$, the A.P. is a constant sequence.\n\n### 2. General Term of an A.P.\n\nLet $a$ be the first term and $d$ be the common difference.\n* First term: $a_1 = a$\n* Second term: $a_2 = a + d$\n* Third term: $a_3 = a + 2d$\n\nBy induction, the $n^{th}$ term ($a_n$) is given by:\n\n$$ a_n = a + (n-1)d $$\n\n#### Linear Property\nThe $n^{th}$ term of an A.P. is always a **linear expression** in $n$. i.e., $a_n = An + B$, where $A = d$ (common difference) and $B = a-d$.\n\n### 3. $n^{th}$ Term from the End\n\nIf an A.P. has $m$ terms in total, the $n^{th}$ term from the end is the $(m-n+1)^{th}$ term from the beginning.\nAlternatively, if $l$ is the last term, the sequence reversed is an A.P. with first term $l$ and common difference $-d$.\n\n$$ a_n(\\text{from end}) = l - (n-1)d $$\n\n### 4. Sum of First $n$ Terms ($S_n$)\n\nLet $S_n$ denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of an A.P.\n$$ S_n = a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + ... + (a+(n-2)d) + (a+(n-1)d) $$\n\n**Derivation (Gaussian Method):**\nWrite the sum in reverse order:\n$$ S_n = (a+(n-1)d) + (a+(n-2)d) + ... + (a+d) + a $$\n\nAdding the two equations term by term:\n$$ 2S_n = [2a+(n-1)d] + [2a+(n-1)d] + ... + [2a+(n-1)d] $$\n\nThere are $n$ such terms.\n$$ 2S_n = n [2a + (n-1)d] $$\n\n$$ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} [2a + (n-1)d] $$\n\nAlternatively, using the last term $l = a + (n-1)d$:\n\n$$ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a + l) $$\n\n#### Quadratic Property of Sum\nThe sum of $n$ terms of an A.P. is always a **quadratic expression** in $n$ of the form $S_n = An^2 + Bn$, with no constant term. The common difference $d = 2A$.\n\n### 5. Arithmetic Mean (A.M.)\n\nIf three numbers $a, A, b$ are in A.P., then $A$ is called the **Arithmetic Mean** of $a$ and $b$.\n\n$$ A - a = b - A \\implies 2A = a + b \\implies A = \\frac{a+b}{2} $$\n\n**Inserting $n$ Arithmetic Means:**\nTo insert $n$ numbers $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ between $a$ and $b$ such that the resulting sequence is an A.P.:\nTotal terms = $n + 2$.\nLet $d$ be the common difference.\nLast term $b = a + ((n+2)-1)d \\implies b = a + (n+1)d$.\n\n$$ d = \\frac{b-a}{n+1} $$\n\nThen, $A_k = a + k\\left(\\frac{b-a}{n+1}\\right)$.\n\n### 6. Important Properties of A.P.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** Sum of terms equidistant from the beginning and end is constant and equal to the sum of the first and last terms.\n    $$ a_k + a_{n-k+1} = a_1 + a_n $$\n2.  **Linear Operations:** If a constant is added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided (non-zero) to each term of an A.P., the resulting sequence is also an A.P.\n3.  **Selection of Terms:**\n    * 3 terms: $a-d, a, a+d$ (Sum = $3a$)\n    * 4 terms: $a-3d, a-d, a+d, a+3d$ (Sum = $4a$, common difference $2d$)\n    * 5 terms: $a-2d, a-d, a, a+d, a+2d$ (Sum = $5a$)",

Definition\n\nA **Geometric Progression (G.P.)** is a sequence where each term (except the first) is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a non-zero constant called the **common ratio** ($r$).\n\nLet $a_1, a_2, ...$ be a G.P. Then:\n$$ \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = r \\quad \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N} $$\n\n### 2.

Sum of First $n$ Terms ($S_n$)\n\n$$ S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1} $$\n\n**Derivation:**\nMultiply the sum by $r$:\n$$ rS_n = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^n $$\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n$$ S_n - rS_n = a - ar^n $$\n$$ S_n(1-r) = a(1-r^n) $$\n\nThus, three cases arise:\n1.  **If $r \\neq 1$:**\n    $$ S_n = \\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad S_n = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r} $$\n2.  **If $r = 1$:** The sequence is $a, a, a, ...$. Sum is simply:\n    $$ S_n = na $$\n\n### 4. Sum to Infinity ($S_\\infty$)\n\nThis is a concept critical for calculus and physics applications. If $|r| < 1$ (i.e., $-1 < r < 1$), then as $n \\to \\infty$, the term $r^n$ approaches 0.\n\n$$ S_\\infty = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} = \\frac{a(1-0)}{1-r} $$\n\n$$ S_\\infty = \\frac{a}{1-r} \\quad (|r| < 1) $$\n\n### 5. Geometric Mean (G.M.)\n\nIf three non-zero positive numbers $a, G, b$ are in G.P., then $G$ is called the **Geometric Mean** of $a$ and $b$.\n\n$$ \\frac{G}{a} = \\frac{b}{G} \\implies G^2 = ab \\implies G = \\sqrt{ab} $$\n\n**Inserting $n$ Geometric Means:**\nTo insert $n$ numbers $G_1, G_2, ..., G_n$ between $a$ and $b$:\nTotal terms = $n+2$.\nLet $r$ be the common ratio.\nLast term $b = a r^{n+1}$.\n\n$$ r = \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n+1}} $$\n\nThen $G_k = a \\cdot \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{k}{n+1}}$.\n\n### 6. Properties of G.P.\n\n1.  **Product Property:** The product of terms equidistant from the beginning and the end is constant.\n    $$ a_k \\cdot a_{n-k+1} = a_1 \\cdot a_n $$\n2.  **Logarithmic Link:** If $a_1, a_2, ...$ are in G.P. (positive terms), then $\\log a_1, \\log a_2, ...$ are in A.P.\n3.  **Selection of Terms:**\n    * 3 terms: $a/r, a, ar$ (Product = $a^3$)\n    * 4 terms: $a/r^3, a/r, ar, ar^3$ (Common ratio $r^2$)",

Algebra, on the other hand, deals with numbers and equations. **René Descartes (1596-1650)** revolutionized mathematics by combining these two fields into **Coordinate Geometry** (or Analytical Geometry).\n\nThe core idea is simple yet profound: **A point in a plane is a pair of numbers $(x, y)$, and a curve in a plane is an equation $f(x, y) = 0$.**\n\n### 2. Recap of Earlier Concepts\nBefore diving into lines, let us rigorously recall the tools from Class 10.\n\n#### A. Distance Formula\nThe distance $d$ between two points $P(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2)$ is derived from the Pythagoras Theorem:\n$$ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} $$\n* **Note:** Distance is always non-negative.\n* **Properties:** $PQ = 0 \\iff P = Q$.\n\n#### B. Section Formula\nThe coordinates of a point $P(x, y)$ dividing the line segment joining $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ internally in the ratio $m:n$ are:\n$$ x = \\frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \\quad y = \\frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n} $$\n* **Midpoint Formula:** If $m:n = 1:1$, then $P = (\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$.\n* **External Division:** If the ratio is $m:n$ externally, replace '$+$' with '$-$'. (Important for JEE).\n\n#### C. Area of a Triangle\nFor a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$:\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| $$\n* If Area = 0, the three points are **collinear** (lie on a straight line).\n* This determinant form is crucial for understanding linear dependence.\n\n### 3. Locus of a Point\nA **Locus** is the path traced by a point moving under specific geometric conditions. The equation of a straight line is essentially the locus of a point moving in a constant direction.",

Since $\\tan(180-\\theta) = -\\tan \\theta$, the value can be positive or negative.\nTo find the **acute** angle $\\theta$, we take the modulus:\n$$ \\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{m_2 - m_1}{1 + m_1 m_2} \\right| $$\n\n* If $1 + m_1 m_2 = 0$, denominator is zero $\\implies \\tan \\theta = \\infty \\implies \\theta = 90^\\circ$.\n* If $m_1 = m_2$, numerator is zero $\\implies \\theta = 0^\\circ$ (Parallel).\n\n### 3. Collinearity of Three Points\nThree points $A, B, C$ are collinear if and only if the slope of $AB$ is equal to the slope of $BC$.\n$$ m_{AB} = m_{BC} $$\nThis is logically equivalent to saying the angle between $AB$ and $BC$ is $0^\\circ$ or $180^\\circ$.",

Geometric Construction\nThe term \"Conic Section\" is derived from the fact that these curves are obtained by taking sections (slices) of a cone.\n\n**The Double-Napped Right Circular Cone:**\nConsider a fixed vertical line $l$ (Axis) and another line $m$ (Generator) intersecting it at a fixed point $V$ (Vertex) making an angle $\\alpha$ ($0 < \\alpha < 90^\\circ$).\nWhen the line $m$ rotates around $l$ maintaining the constant angle $\\alpha$, it generates a surface called a **Double-Napped Right Circular Cone**.\n* **Nappes:** The vertex $V$ separates the cone into two parts: the Upper Nappe and the Lower Nappe.\n\n### 2. Intersection with a Plane\nLet a plane intersect the cone. The curve of intersection depends on the position of the plane relative to the vertex and the axis.\nLet $\\beta$ be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical axis of the cone.\n\n#### Case 1: Plane passes through Vertex (Degenerate Conics)\nIf the plane cuts through the vertex $V$, the section is not a curve but a geometric entity:\n1.  **Point:** If $\\beta = 90^\\circ$ (Plane perpendicular to axis). Intersection is just $V$.\n2.  **Line:** If $\\beta = \\alpha$ (Plane touches the generator). Intersection is a line.\n3.  **Pair of Intersecting Lines:** If $0 \\le \\beta < \\alpha$ (Plane cuts through both nappes). Intersection is two lines crossing at $V$.\n\n#### Case 2: Plane does NOT pass through Vertex (Non-Degenerate Conics)\n1.  **Circle:** If $\\beta = 90^\\circ$. The plane is perpendicular to the axis. The section is a circle.\n2.  **Ellipse:** If $\\alpha < \\beta < 90^\\circ$. The plane cuts obliquely across one nappe.\n3.  **Parabola:** If $\\beta = \\alpha$.

The Rectangular Coordinate System\nConsider three mutually perpendicular lines passing through a common point $O$ (Origin).\n* **X-axis:** Horizontal.\n* **Y-axis:** Vertical (in 2D context) or Horizontal perpendicular to X.\n* **Z-axis:** Perpendicular to the XY plane.\n\nThese axes form three mutually perpendicular planes:\n1.  **XY-Plane:** Contains x and y axes ($z=0$).\n2.  **YZ-Plane:** Contains y and z axes ($x=0$).\n3.  **ZX-Plane:** Contains z and x axes ($y=0$).\n\n### 3. Octants\nJust as 2 axes divide a plane into 4 quadrants, 3 axes divide space into **8 Octants**.\n\n**Naming Convention:**\n* The positive directions are denoted by $X, Y, Z$.\n* The negative directions are denoted by $X', Y', Z'$.\n* Octants are named by the axes enclosing them (e.g., $OXYZ$, $OX'YZ'$).\n\n**Sign Convention Table:**\n\n| Octant | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Name** | $OXYZ$ | $OX'YZ$ | $OX'Y'Z$ | $OXY'Z$ | $OXYZ'$ | $OX'YZ'$ | $OX'Y'Z'$ | $OXY'Z'$ |\n| **x** | + | – | – | + | + | – | – | + |\n| **y** | + | + | – | – | + | + | – | – |\n| **z** | + | + | + | + | – | – | – | – |\n\n* **Memory Tip:**\n    * Z is Positive for Octants I to IV (Top floor).\n    * Z is Negative for Octants V to VIII (Basement).\n    * The x and y signs follow the standard 2D Quadrant pattern (I to IV) for both the top and bottom groups.",

However, the real world is dynamic. Planets move, populations grow, and coffee cools. \n\n**Calculus** is the branch of mathematics invented to study **change** and **motion**.\n\nIt was independently developed by **Isaac Newton** and **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** in the 17th century to answer questions like:\n1.  What is the instantaneous velocity of an object?\n2.  What is the exact slope of a curve at a single point?\n3.  How do we find the area under a curved boundary?\n\n### 2. The Core Concept: The Limit\nTo calculate instantaneous speed (distance/time) at a specific moment ($t=t_0$), the time interval $\\Delta t$ must become zero. But division by zero is undefined in Algebra. \n\nCalculus solves this by asking: *\"What happens to the ratio as $\\Delta t$ gets closer and closer to 0, without actually being 0?\"*\nThis leads to the concept of the **Limit**.\n\n* **Differential Calculus:** Focuses on Derivatives (Rates of change).\n* **Integral Calculus:** Focuses on Integration (Accumulation of quantities).\nThis chapter focuses on the foundation: **Limits** and **Derivatives**.",

            "content": "### 1. Intuitive Idea\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$.\nIf we try to find the value at $x=2$, we get $f(2) = \\frac{4-4}{2-2} = \\frac{0}{0}$, which is **undefined** (Indeterminate Form).\n\nHowever, let's calculate values of $f(x)$ for $x$ very close to 2:\n\n**Approaching 2 from the Left ($x < 2$):**\n* $x = 1.9 \\implies f(x) = 3.9$\n* $x = 1.99 \\implies f(x) = 3.99$\n* $x = 1.999 \\implies f(x) = 3.999$\n\n**Approaching 2 from the Right ($x > 2$):**\n* $x = 2.1 \\implies f(x) = 4.1$\n* $x = 2.01 \\implies f(x) = 4.01$\n* $x = 2.001 \\implies f(x) = 4.001$\n\n**Observation:** As $x$ gets closer to 2, $f(x)$ gets closer to 4. We say \"the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 2 is 4\".\n\n**Notation:**\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to 2} f(x) = 4 $$\n\n### 2. Left Hand Limit (LHL) and Right Hand Limit (RHL)\nFor a limit to exist, the behavior of the function must be consistent from both sides.\n\n* **Left Hand Limit (LHL):** The expected value of $f$ at $x=a$ given the values of $f$ near $x$ to the left of $a$ ($x < a$).\n    Notation: $\\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x)$\n* **Right Hand Limit (RHL):** The expected value of $f$ at $x=a$ given the values of $f$ near $x$ to the right of $a$ ($x > a$).\n    Notation: $\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x)$\n\n### 3. Existence of a Limit\nLimit $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$ exists **if and only if**:\n1.  LHL exists (is finite).\n2.  RHL exists (is finite).\n3.  LHL = RHL.\n\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L \\implies \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L $$\n\n**Important:** The value of the function *at* $x=a$ (i.e., $f(a)$) does not matter for the limit. The limit is about the *journey*, not the *destination*.\n\n### 4. Algebra of Limits\nLet $f$ and $g$ be two functions such that $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)$ and $\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)$ exist.\n1.  **Sum:** $\\lim_{x \\to a} [f(x) + g(x)] = \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) + \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)$\n2.  **Difference:** $\\lim_{x \\to a} [f(x) - g(x)] = \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) - \\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)$\n3.  **Product:** $\\lim_{x \\to a} [f(x) \\cdot g(x)] = [\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)] \\cdot [\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)]$\n4.  **Quotient:** $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)}{\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)}$, provided $\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) \\neq 0$.",

These give us a single value that represents the entire data set. However, an average alone can be misleading.\n\n**Consider this example:**\nTwo cricketers, Player A and Player B, have the following scores in 5 matches:\n* **Player A:** 48, 50, 53, 49, 50. (Mean = 50)\n* **Player B:** 0, 0, 100, 100, 50. (Mean = 50)\n\nBoth have the same mean score of 50. However, Player A is consistent, while Player B is volatile (unreliable). The mean fails to capture this **variability** or **spread**.\n\n### 2. Dispersion\nTo understand data fully, we need to know how 'scattered' the data points are around the average. This property is called **Dispersion**.\n\n**Measures of Dispersion:**\n1.  **Range:** The simplest measure (Max - Min).\n2.  **Quartile Deviation:** Based on the middle 50% of data.\n3.  **Mean Deviation:** The average of absolute differences from the center.\n4.  **Standard Deviation (and Variance):** The most mathematically robust measure, based on squared differences.\n\n### 3. Range\n$$ \\text{Range} = \\text{Maximum Value} - \\text{Minimum Value} $$\n* *Pros:* Easy to calculate.\n* *Cons:* Very sensitive to outliers.

In Class 11, we formalize this using **Set Theory**. This is known as the **Axiomatic Approach to Probability**.\n\n### 2. Random Experiment\nAn experiment is called a **Random Experiment** if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  It has more than one possible outcome.\n2.  It is not possible to predict the outcome in advance.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Tossing a fair coin:** Outcomes are Head (H) or Tail (T). We cannot predict which one will occur.\n* **Rolling a die:** Outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n* *Counter-Example:* Tossing a stone in the air. We know it will fall down. This is a deterministic experiment, not random.\n\n### 3. Outcomes and Sample Space\n* **Outcome:** A possible result of a random experiment.\n* **Sample Space ($S$):** The set of *all* possible outcomes of a random experiment. Each element of the sample space is called a **sample point**.\n\n**Deriving Sample Spaces:**\n1.  **Two Coins:** Tossing two coins (or one coin twice).\n    $S = \\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$.\n    $n(S) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n2.  **Two Dice:** Rolling two dice.\n    $S = \\{(1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,6), (2,1), ..., (6,6)\\}$.\n    $n(S) = 6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n3.  **Coin and Die:** Tossing a coin; if Head, roll a die.\n    $S = \\{T, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6\\}$.\n    Note: Sample spaces need not have \"symmetric\" looking elements.\n\n4.  **Drawing Cards:** From a deck of 52.\n    $n(S) = 52$.\n    *Suits:* Spades ($\\spadesuit$), Clubs ($\\clubsuit$) [Black]; Hearts ($\\heartsuit$), Diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$) [Red].\n    *Ranks:* 2, 3, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A.",

Types of Events\n1.  **Impossible Event:** The empty set $\\phi$. It contains no sample points.\n    * *Ex:* Rolling a 7 on a standard die.\n2.  **Sure Event:** The whole sample space $S$.

            "content": "### 1. Review of Prerequisites\nBefore diving into Class 12 concepts, we recall the rigorous definition of a relation from Class 11.\n\n**Cartesian Product:** Given two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$, the Cartesian product $A \\times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$.\n$$ A \\times B = \\{ (a, b) : a \\in A, b \\in B \\} $$\n\n**Relation:** A relation $R$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is an arbitrary subset of $A \\times B$. If $(a, b) \\in R$, we say \"$a$ is related to $b$\" and write $a R b$.\n\n**Relation on a Set:** A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is a subset of $A \\times A$.\n\n### 2. Types of Relations\nWe categorize relations based on their internal structure and properties. Let $A$ be a non-empty set and $R$ be a relation on $A$.\n\n#### A. Trivial Relations\n1.  **Empty Relation:** $R = \\phi \\subset A \\times A$. No element of $A$ is related to any element of $A$. Example: Relation $R$ on set of boys $A$ defined by \"$a$ is sister of $b$\". Since no boy can be a sister, $R = \\phi$.\n2.  **Universal Relation:** $R = A \\times A$. Every element of $A$ is related to every element of $A$. Example: Relation $R$ on set of integers $A$ defined by \"$|a - b| \\ge 0$\". This is always true.\n\n#### B. Fundamental Properties (The Core Trio)\nThese three properties are crucial for defining mathematical structures.\n\n1.  **Reflexive Relation:**\n    A relation $R$ is reflexive if **every** element of $A$ is related to itself.\n    $$ \\forall a \\in A, \\quad (a, a) \\in R $$\n    * *Warning:* If even one element $a \\in A$ exists such that $(a, a) \\notin R$, the relation is NOT reflexive.\n    * *Example:* \"Is equal to\" (=) is reflexive because $a = a$.\n    * *Counter-Example:* \"Is greater than\" (>) is NOT reflexive because $a \\ngtr a$.\n\n2.  **Symmetric Relation:**\n    A relation $R$ is symmetric if whenever $a$ is related to $b$, $b$ is also related to $a$.\n    $$ \\forall a, b \\in A, \\quad (a, b) \\in R \\implies (b, a) \\in R $$\n    * *Example:* \"Is perpendicular to\" ($\\perp$) is symmetric. If $L_1 \\perp L_2$, then $L_2 \\perp L_1$.\n    * *Counter-Example:* \"Is father of\" is NOT symmetric.\n\n3.  **Transitive Relation:**\n    A relation $R$ is transitive if whenever $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $c$, then $a$ is related to $c$.\n    $$ \\forall a, b, c \\in A, \\quad [(a, b) \\in R \\land (b, c) \\in R] \\implies (a, c) \\in R $$\n    * *Subtlety:* If $(a, b) \\in R$ but there is no $c$ such that $(b, c) \\in R$, the condition is vacuously true, and transitivity is NOT violated.\n    * *Example:* \"Is less than\" (<) is transitive. $a < b$ and $b < c$ implies $a < c$.\n    * *Counter-Example:* \"Is perpendicular to\" in 2D plane. $L_1 \\perp L_2$ and $L_2 \\perp L_3$ implies $L_1 || L_3$, not $L_1 \\perp L_3$.\n\n### 3. Equivalence Relation\nA relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called an **Equivalence Relation** if it is Reflexive, Symmetric, AND Transitive.\n* Equivalence relations generalize the concept of \"equality\". They partition a set into disjoint subsets where elements within a subset are essentially \"the same\" under the given relation.\n\n### 4. Equivalence Classes\nLet $R$ be an equivalence relation on set $A$. For any $a \\in A$, the **Equivalence Class** of $a$, denoted by $[a]$ or $\\bar{a}$, is the set of all elements in $A$ that are related to $a$.\n$$ [a] = \\{ x \\in A : (x, a) \\in R \\} $$\n\n**The Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations:**\nAn equivalence relation $R$ on a set $A$ partitions $A$ into mutually disjoint equivalence classes whose union is $A$.\n1.  All elements in $[a]$ are related to each other.\n2.  No element of $[a]$ is related to any element of $[b]$ if $[a] \\neq [b]$.\n3.  $[a] \\cap [b] = \\phi$ or $[a] = [b]$.\n4.  $\\bigcup_{a \\in A} [a] = A$.\n\n* *Example:* Relation $R$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$ defined by \"$a - b$ is divisible by 2\".\n    * $[0] = \\{ ..., -2, 0, 2, 4, ... \\}$ (Even integers)\n    * $[1] = \\{ ..., -1, 1, 3, 5, ... \\}$ (Odd integers)\n    * These two classes partition $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### 5. Advanced Relation Types (JEE Focus)\n* **Antisymmetric Relation:** A relation is antisymmetric if $(a, b) \\in R$ and $(b, a) \\in R$ implies $a = b$. (Used in Partial Ordering, e.g., $\\le$).\n* **Partial Order Relation:** Reflexive, Antisymmetric, and Transitive. (e.g., \"subset of\" $\\subseteq$).\n* **Total Number of Relations:** If $n(A) = m$, total relations = $2^{m^2}$.\n* **Number of Reflexive Relations:** $2^{m^2 - m}$.\n* **Number of Symmetric Relations:** $2^{m(m+1)/2}$.",

If you get *only* $x=y$, it is one-one.\n2.  **Graphical Method (Horizontal Line Test):** If any horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once, it is one-one.\n3.  **Calculus Method:** For continuous differentiable functions, if $f'(x) > 0$ always (strictly increasing) or $f'(x) < 0$ always (strictly decreasing) in the domain, then $f$ is one-one.\n\n* *Counter-Example:* $f(x) = x^2$ is NOT one-one on $\\mathbb{R}$ because $f(2) = 4$ and $f(-2) = 4$, but $2 \\neq -2$.\n\n### 3.

Bijective Function\nA function is **Bijective** if it is both **One-One and Onto**.\n* Bijectivity is the necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be **Invertible**.\n* Bijective functions set up a \"perfect pairing\" (one-to-one correspondence) between elements of $A$ and $B$.\n\n### 5. Counting Functions (JEE Advanced)\nLet $n(A) = m$ and $n(B) = n$.\n1.  **Total Functions:** $n^m$.\n2.  **One-One Functions (Injections):**\n    * If $m > n$: 0\n    * If $m \\le n$: $^nP_m = \\frac{n!}{(n-m)!}$\n3.  **Onto Functions (Surjections):**\n    * If $m < n$: 0\n    * If $m \\ge n$: $n^m - ^nC_1(n-1)^m + ^nC_2(n-2)^m - ... + (-1)^{n-1} ^nC_{n-1}(1)^m$ (Using Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion).\n4.  **Bijective Functions:**\n    * If $m \\neq n$: 0\n    * If $m = n$: $n!$",

If not, we must restrict the domain of $f$ to make it valid.\n\n### 2. Properties of Composition\n1.  **Non-Commutative:** In general, $g \\circ f \\neq f \\circ g$.

The Inverse Problem\nFrom Chapter 1, we know that a function $f: A \\to B$ is invertible if and only if it is **bijective** (one-one and onto).\n\nConsider the sine function: $f(x) = \\sin x$.\n* **Domain:** $\\mathbb{R}$\n* **Range:** $[-1, 1]$\n\nIs it one-one? No. $\\sin(0) = 0, \\sin(\\pi) = 0, \\sin(2\\pi) = 0$. Many inputs give the same output.\nIs it onto (if codomain is $\\mathbb{R}$)? No. The output never exceeds 1 or goes below -1.\n\nThus, standard trigonometric functions are **NOT** invertible on their natural domains.\n\n### 2. Restricting the Domain\nTo make trigonometric functions invertible, we must restrict their domains to intervals where they are one-one (monotonic) and adjust the codomain to match the range.\n\n**For Sine:**\nIf we restrict the domain to $[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, the function becomes one-one and takes all values from -1 to 1 exactly once.\nThus, we define the inverse sine function, $\\sin^{-1} x$ (or $\\arcsin x$), as the inverse of this restricted sine function.\n\n### 3. Principal Value Branch\nFor each trigonometric function, there are infinitely many intervals where it is one-one. By convention, mathematicians have agreed upon one specific interval for each function, called the **Principal Value Branch**.\nWhen we ask for \"the\" value of $\\sin^{-1} x$, we always mean the value in this principal branch.",

            "content": "### 1. The Necessity of Matrices\nIn standard algebra, we deal with single numbers (scalars) representing quantities like length, mass, or time. However, complex systems involves multiple variables interacting simultaneously.\n\n**Example:** Consider a shop selling 3 items (Pens, Pencils, Erasers) across 2 days.\n* Day 1: 30 Pens, 20 Pencils, 10 Erasers.\n* Day 2: 40 Pens, 25 Pencils, 15 Erasers.\n\nWe can represent this data as a rectangular array:\n$$ \\begin{bmatrix} 30 & 20 & 10 \\\\ 40 & 25 & 15 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThis structure is a **Matrix**. It allows us to manipulate the *entire dataset* as a single mathematical object.\n\n### 2. Formal Definition\nA **matrix** is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The numbers or functions are called the **elements** or **entries** of the matrix.\n\n**Notation:**\nMatrices are denoted by capital letters ($A, B, C...$).\n$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\dots & a_{1n} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\dots & a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\dots & a_{mn} \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n### 3. Order of a Matrix\nA matrix having $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called a matrix of order $m \\times n$ (read as \"m by n\").\n* **Horizontal lines** are Rows ($R_1, R_2, ...$).\n* **Vertical lines** are Columns ($C_1, C_2, ...$).\n* **Total elements** = $mn$.\n\n### 4. General Element Representation\nAn element occurring in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column is denoted by $a_{ij}$.\nThus, $A = [a_{ij}]_{m \\times n}$, where $1 \\le i \\le m$ and $1 \\le j \\le n$.\n\n**Construction of Matrices:**\nOften, we define a matrix by a rule for its elements. For example, construct a $2 \\times 2$ matrix where $a_{ij} = i + j$.\n* $a_{11} = 1+1=2$\n* $a_{12} = 1+2=3$\n* $a_{21} = 2+1=3$\n* $a_{22} = 2+2=4$\nResult: $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$",

Example: $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n* **Square Matrix:** Number of rows equals number of columns ($m=n$). Order is often just called $n$.\n* **Rectangular Matrix:** $m \\neq n$.\n\n### 2. Based on Elements (Square Matrices)\nLet $A = [a_{ij}]$ be a square matrix of order $n$.\n\n* **Diagonal Elements:** Elements $a_{ij}$ where $i=j$ (i.e., $a_{11}, a_{22}, ..., a_{nn}$). This is the **Principal Diagonal**.\n\n* **Diagonal Matrix:** A square matrix where all non-diagonal elements are zero.\n    $$ a_{ij} = 0 \\quad \\text{if } i \\neq j $$\n    Notation: $A = \\text{diag}(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n)$.\n\n* **Scalar Matrix:** A diagonal matrix where all diagonal elements are equal.\n    $$ a_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 0 & i \\neq j \\\\ k & i = j \\end{cases} $$\n\n* **Identity Matrix ($I$):** A scalar matrix where the diagonal constant is 1.\n    $$ a_{ij} = \\begin{cases} 0 & i \\neq j \\\\ 1 & i = j \\end{cases} $$\n    Properties: $AI = IA = A$.

Triangular Matrices (JEE Focus)\n* **Upper Triangular:** All elements *below* the main diagonal are zero ($a_{ij} = 0$ for $i > j$).\n* **Lower Triangular:** All elements *above* the main diagonal are zero ($a_{ij} = 0$ for $i < j$).\n* *Note:* A diagonal matrix is both upper and lower triangular.\n\n### 4. Trace of a Matrix (Advanced)\nThe sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix is called the **Trace**.\n$$ \\text{tr}(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{ii} = a_{11} + a_{22} + ... + a_{nn} $$\n**Properties:**\n* $\\text{tr}(A+B) = \\text{tr}(A) + \\text{tr}(B)$\n* $\\text{tr}(kA) = k \\text{tr}(A)$\n* $\\text{tr}(AB) = \\text{tr}(BA)$ (Cyclic property - Very useful in JEE)",

Corresponding elements are identical ($a_{ij} = b_{ij}$ for all $i, j$).\n\n### 2. Addition of Matrices\nIf $A$ and $B$ are of the **same order**, their sum $A+B$ is obtained by adding corresponding elements.\n$$ C = A + B \\implies c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij} $$\n* **Properties:**\n    * **Commutative:** $A + B = B + A$\n    * **Associative:** $(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)$\n    * **Additive Identity:** $A + O = A$\n    * **Additive Inverse:** $A + (-A) = O$\n\n### 3. Scalar Multiplication\nTo multiply a matrix $A$ by a scalar $k$, we multiply **every** element of $A$ by $k$.\n$$ B = kA \\implies b_{ij} = k \\cdot a_{ij} $$\n* *Contrast with Determinants:* In determinants, a scalar multiplies only one row or column. In matrices, it scales the whole array.\n\n### 4. Multiplication of Matrices (The Core Concept)\nMatrix multiplication is NOT element-wise.

Non-zero matrices can multiply to give a zero matrix. (These are called *Zero Divisors*).\n\n### 5.

Transpose of a Matrix\nThe transpose of a matrix $A$, denoted by $A^T$ or $A'$, is obtained by interchanging its rows and columns.\nIf $A = [a_{ij}]_{m \\times n}$, then $A' = [a_{ji}]_{n \\times m}$.\n\n**Properties:**\n1.  $(A')' = A$\n2.  $(kA)' = kA'$\n3.  $(A + B)' = A' + B'$\n4.  **Reversal Law:** $(AB)' = B' A'$ (Crucial property. The order flips).\n    * Generalization: $(ABC)' = C' B' A'$.\n\n### 2. Symmetric Matrix\nA square matrix $A$ is symmetric if $A' = A$.\n* Condition: $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all $i, j$.\n* The matrix is symmetric about the principal diagonal.\n* *Example:* $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n### 3. Skew-Symmetric Matrix\nA square matrix $A$ is skew-symmetric if $A' = -A$.\n* Condition: $a_{ij} = -a_{ji}$ for all $i, j$.\n* **Diagonal Property:** For diagonal elements ($i=j$), $a_{ii} = -a_{ii} \\implies 2a_{ii} = 0 \\implies a_{ii} = 0$.\n    * **Theorem:** All diagonal elements of a skew-symmetric matrix are zero.\n\n### 4. Representation Theorem\nAny square matrix $A$ can be uniquely expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix.\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{2}(A + A') + \\frac{1}{2}(A - A') $$\n* Let $P = \\frac{1}{2}(A + A')$.

Invertible Matrices\nA square matrix $A$ of order $n$ is invertible if there exists a square matrix $B$ of the same order such that:\n$$ AB = BA = I $$\nHere, $B$ is called the **Inverse** of $A$, denoted $A^{-1}$.\n\n**Properties:**\n1.  **Uniqueness:** If an inverse exists, it is unique.\n2.  **Reversal Law:** $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}$.\n3.  $(A')^{-1} = (A^{-1})'$.\n4.  A rectangular matrix does not possess an inverse (because $AB$ and $BA$ cannot both be identity matrices of same order).\n\n### 2. Elementary Operations (Transformations)\nThere are 6 operations (3 row, 3 column) used to transform matrices. These are equivalent to solving linear equations.\n\n**Row Operations ($R$):**\n1.  **Interchange:** $R_i \\leftrightarrow R_j$ (Swap two rows).\n2.  **Scaling:** $R_i \\to kR_i$ (Multiply a row by non-zero $k$).\n3.  **Addition:** $R_i \\to R_i + kR_j$ (Add a multiple of another row).\n\n*(Similar rules apply for Columns $C$)*.\n\n### 3. Finding Inverse by Elementary Operations (Gauss-Jordan)\nTo find $A^{-1}$:\n1.  Write the equation $A = IA$.\n2.  Apply a sequence of elementary **Row Operations** on $A$ (LHS) to reduce it to the Identity matrix $I$.\n3.  Simultaneously apply the **same** operations on $I$ (RHS).\n4.  The equation transforms from $A = IA$ to $I = BA$.\n5.  By definition, $B = A^{-1}$.\n\n**Important:** If using Row operations, stick to row operations throughout. Do not mix row and column operations in the same solution for this method.\n\n**Existence:** If during the process, all elements of a row (or column) on LHS become zero, then $A^{-1}$ does not exist (Matrix is Singular).\n\n### 4.

            "content": "### 1. Conceptual Foundation\nIn the previous chapter (Matrices), we treated systems of numbers as single rectangular entities. However, for **Square Matrices**, there exists a powerful scalar value that characterizes the matrix uniquely. This value is called the **Determinant**.\n\n**Why do we need it?**\nConsider the system of linear equations:\n$$ a_1 x + b_1 y = c_1 $$\n$$ a_2 x + b_2 y = c_2 $$\nUsing algebra, this system has a unique solution if and only if $a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \\neq 0$. The number $a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1$ \"determines\" the uniqueness of the solution. This number is the determinant of the coefficient matrix.\n\n### 2. Formal Definition\nLet $M$ be the set of all square matrices of order $n$. We can define a function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{K}$ (where $\\mathbb{K}$ is a scalar field like $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$) which associates each matrix $A \\in M$ to a unique number.\n\n$$ f(A) = |A| = \\det(A) $$\n\n* **Note:** The symbol $|A|$ represents the determinant, **not** the modulus or absolute value. Determinants can be negative.\n* **Restriction:** Determinants are defined **only** for square matrices.\n\n### 3. Expansion of Determinants\n\n**A. Determinant of Order 1:**\nIf $A = [a]$, then $|A| = a$.\n\n**B. Determinant of Order 2:**\nIf $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix}$, then:\n$$ |A| = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{21}a_{12} $$\n*Geometric Interpretation:* The absolute value of this determinant represents the area of the parallelogram formed by the row vectors.\n\n**C. Determinant of Order 3:**\nIf $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{bmatrix}$.\nWe can expand along any row or column. Expanding along Row 1 ($R_1$):\n$$ |A| = (-1)^{1+1} a_{11} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\ a_{32} & a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{1+2} a_{12} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{21} & a_{23} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{33} \\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{1+3} a_{13} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{21} & a_{22} \\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ |A| = a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{32}a_{23}) - a_{12}(a_{21}a_{33} - a_{31}a_{23}) + a_{13}(a_{21}a_{32} - a_{31}a_{22}) $$\n\n**General Rule for Sign:** The sign corresponds to $(-1)^{i+j}$. For a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, the signs are:\n$$ \\begin{bmatrix} + & - & + \\\\ - & + & - \\\\ + & - & + \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n**Sarrus Rule (Only for 3x3):**\nA visual mnemonic involving repeating the first two columns and summing diagonals.

If you can draw the entire graph on a piece of paper **without lifting your pen**, the function is said to be continuous.\n\n* **Continuous Curve:** No holes, no jumps, no breaks.\n* **Discontinuous Curve:** If there is a hole (missing point), a jump (sudden change in value), or a vertical asymptote (going to infinity), the pen must be lifted. The function is discontinuous at that point.\n\n### 2. Formal Definition of Continuity\nMathematically, 'not lifting the pen' translates to the behavior of limits.\nA function $f(x)$ is continuous at a point $x = c$ if:\n1.  The function is **defined** at $c$ (i.e., $f(c)$ exists).\n2.  The **limit** of the function as $x$ approaches $c$ exists (i.e., $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x)$ exists).\n3.  The limit equals the function value.\n\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c) $$\n\n**Expanded Condition (LHL = RHL = Value):**\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = f(c) $$\n\n* **LHL (Left Hand Limit):** The value $f(x)$ approaches as $x$ gets closer to $c$ from the left ($x < c$).\n* **RHL (Right Hand Limit):** The value $f(x)$ approaches as $x$ gets closer to $c$ from the right ($x > c$).\n\n### 3. Types of Discontinuity (Advanced Insight)\nIf a function is not continuous at $c$, it is discontinuous. We classify discontinuities based on which condition fails:\n\n1.  **Removable Discontinuity:**\n    * Limit exists (LHL = RHL), but does not equal $f(c)$ (or $f(c)$ is undefined).\n    * *Visual:* A hole in the graph.\n    * *Example:* $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}$ at $x=2$.\n2.  **Jump Discontinuity:**\n    * LHL and RHL exist but are not equal ($LHL \\neq RHL$).\n    * *Visual:* The graph steps up or down.\n    * *Example:* Greatest Integer Function $f(x) = [x]$ at integer points.\n3.  **Infinite Discontinuity:**\n    * Either LHL or RHL (or both) tends to $\\pm \\infty$.\n    * *Visual:* Vertical Asymptote.\n    * *Example:* $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ at $x=0$.\n4.  **Oscillatory Discontinuity:**\n    * The limit does not exist because the function oscillates wildly near $c$.\n    * *Example:* $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$ at $x=0$.\n\n### 4. Continuity on an Interval\n* **Open Interval $(a, b)$:** $f$ is continuous on $(a, b)$ if it is continuous at every point $c \\in (a, b)$.\n* **Closed Interval $[a, b]$:** $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ if:\n    1.  It is continuous on $(a, b)$.\n    2.  Right-continuous at $a$: $\\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$.\n    3.  Left-continuous at $b$: $\\lim_{x \\to b^-} f(x) = f(b)$.\n\n### 5. Algebra of Continuous Functions\nLet $f$ and $g$ be two real functions continuous at a real number $c$. Then:\n1.  **Sum:** $f + g$ is continuous at $c$.\n2.  **Difference:** $f - g$ is continuous at $c$.\n3.  **Product:** $f \\cdot g$ is continuous at $c$.\n4.  **Quotient:** $\\frac{f}{g}$ is continuous at $c$ (provided $g(c) \\neq 0$).\n5.  **Scalar Multiplication:** $\\alpha f$ is continuous at $c$.\n\n**Theorem (Composite Functions):**\nIf $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $g$ is continuous at $f(c)$, then the composite function $g \\circ f$ (defined by $(g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$) is continuous at $c$.\n\n* *Example:* $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)$. Let $u(x) = x^2$ (continuous polynomial) and $v(t) = \\sin t$ (continuous trig function). Then $f(x) = v(u(x))$ is continuous.\n\n### 6. Standard Continuous Functions\nThe following functions are continuous everywhere in their domains:\n* Polynomial functions ($a_n x^n + \\dots + a_0$).\n* Rational functions (where denominator $\\neq 0$).\n* Trigonometric functions (sin, cos continuous everywhere; tan, sec, etc., in their domains).\n* Exponential functions ($e^x, a^x$).\n* Logarithmic functions ($\\ln x$ for $x > 0$).\n* Inverse Trigonometric functions (in their principal domains).\n* Modulus function ($|x|$).",

Differentiability ensures a graph is **smooth**.\nA function is differentiable at a point if it has a unique, non-vertical tangent at that point. Geometrically, this means the graph has no sharp corners, cusps, or kinks.\n\n### 2. Definition of Derivative (First Principles)\nLet $f$ be a real function and $c$ be a point in its domain. The derivative of $f$ at $c$ is defined by:\n\n$$ f'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h} $$\n\nprovided this limit exists.\n\n**Left Hand Derivative (LHD):**\n$$ Lf'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(c-h) - f(c)}{-h} $$\n\n**Right Hand Derivative (RHD):**\n$$ Rf'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h} $$\n\n**Condition for Differentiability:**\nA function is differentiable at $c$ if and only if:\n1.  LHD exists (finite).\n2.  RHD exists (finite).\n3.  LHD = RHD.\n\n### 3. Relation between Continuity and Differentiability\n**Theorem:** If a function $f$ is differentiable at a point $c$, then it is essentially continuous at that point.\n\n**Proof Logic:**\nWe want to show $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)$, which is equivalent to $\\lim_{x \\to c} [f(x) - f(c)] = 0$.\nWrite $f(x) - f(c) = \\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} \\cdot (x - c)$ for $x \\neq c$.\nTaking limits:\n$\\lim_{x \\to c} [f(x) - f(c)] = \\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} \\cdot \\lim_{x \\to c} (x - c)$\n$= f'(c) \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nSo, $\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = f(c)$. Thus, $f$ is continuous.\n\n**Converse is FALSE:**\nEvery differentiable function is continuous, but **every continuous function need not be differentiable**.\n* *Counter-Example:* $f(x) = |x|$ at $x=0$.\n    * Continuity: LHL = RHL = 0. Continuous.\n    * Differentiability:\n        * LHD at 0: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{|h|-0}{h} = \\lim \\frac{-h}{h} = -1$.\n        * RHD at 0: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{|h|-0}{h} = \\lim \\frac{h}{h} = 1$.\n        * LHD $\\neq$ RHD. Not differentiable.\n    * *Geometric Reason:* There is a sharp corner (kink) at $x=0$.\n\n### 4. Rules of Differentiation (Algebra of Derivatives)\nLet $u$ and $v$ be differentiable functions of $x$.\n1.  **Sum/Difference:** $(u \\pm v)' = u' \\pm v'$.\n2.  **Product Rule (Leibniz Rule):** $(uv)' = u'v + uv'$.\n3.  **Quotient Rule:** $\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$ (where $v \\neq 0$).\n\n### 5. Chain Rule (Composite Functions)\nThis is the most critical rule for calculus.\nLet $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$. Then $y = f(g(x))$.\nTo find $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx} $$\n\n**Alternative Notation:**\nIf $h(x) = (f \\circ g)(x)$, then $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n* *Intuition:* Differentiate the \"outer\" function keeping the \"inner\" intact, then multiply by the derivative of the \"inner\" function (Peeling the onion).",

Related Rates (Chain Rule Application)\nOften, two variables $x$ and $y$ are related by an equation, and both change with respect to a third variable (usually time $t$).\nBy the Chain Rule:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\n\n**Common Scenarios:**\n1.  **Geometry:** Area ($A$) and Radius ($r$) of a circle. $\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\pi r^2) = 2\\pi r \\frac{dr}{dt}$.\n2.  **Volume:** Volume ($V$) and Edge ($x$) of a cube. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(x^3) = 3x^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n3.  **Ladder Problems:** Relationship $x^2 + y^2 = L^2$.

Marginal Cost and Revenue (Economics Application)\n* **Marginal Cost (MC):** The instantaneous rate of change of total cost ($C$) with respect to the number of items produced ($x$).\n    $$ MC = \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\n* **Marginal Revenue (MR):** The rate of change of total revenue ($R$) with respect to the number of items sold ($x$).\n    $$ MR = \\frac{dR}{dx} $$",

            "content": "### 1. The Concept of Anti-derivative\nIn differential calculus, we are given a function $f(x)$ and we find its derivative $f'(x)$. Integral calculus asks the reverse question: Given a derivative $f'(x)$, can we find the original function $f(x)$?\n\n**Definition:**\nA function $F(x)$ is called an **antiderivative** (or primitive) of a function $f(x)$ if $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain.\n\n**The Constant of Integration ($C$):**\nIf $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then $F(x) + C$ is also an antiderivative, because:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}[F(x) + C] = F'(x) + 0 = f(x) $$\nHere, $C$ is an arbitrary real constant. This means the antiderivative is not unique; it is a **family of functions**.\n\n**Notation:**\n$$ \\int f(x) dx = F(x) + C $$\n* $\\int$: The Integral Sign (an elongated 'S' for Summation).\n* $f(x)$: The Integrand.\n* $dx$: Indicates integration with respect to variable $x$.\n* $F(x) + C$: The Indefinite Integral.\n\n### 2. Geometric Interpretation\n$y = F(x) + C$ represents a family of curves. For different values of $C$, we get different curves that are parallel to each other (shifted vertically).\n* **Crucial Property:** At any specific $x = a$, the slope of the tangent ($\frac{dy}{dx}$) is the same for all members of the family ($f(a)$). Thus, the tangents to all curves at the points of intersection with the line $x = a$ are parallel.\n\n### 3. Properties of Indefinite Integrals\n1.  **Differentiation Inverse:** $\\frac{d}{dx} \\int f(x) dx = f(x)$ and $\\int f'(x) dx = f(x) + C$.\n2.  **Linearity:**\n    * $\\int [f(x) + g(x)] dx = \\int f(x) dx + \\int g(x) dx$\n    * $\\int k f(x) dx = k \\int f(x) dx$ (where $k$ is a constant).\n\n### 4. Standard Integrals (Derivatives in Reverse)\n* $\\int x^n dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \\quad (n \\neq -1)$\n* $\\int \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln |x| + C$\n* $\\int e^x dx = e^x + C$\n* $\\int a^x dx = \\frac{a^x}{\\ln a} + C$\n* $\\int \\sin x dx = -\\cos x + C$\n* $\\int \\cos x dx = \\sin x + C$\n* $\\int \\sec^2 x dx = \\tan x + C$\n* $\\int \\text{cosec}^2 x dx = -\\cot x + C$\n* $\\int \\sec x \\tan x dx = \\sec x + C$\n* $\\int \\text{cosec } x \\cot x dx = -\\text{cosec } x + C$\n* $\\int \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = \\sin^{-1} x + C$\n* $\\int \\frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \\tan^{-1} x + C$",

But how do we find the area of an irregular shape bounded by a curve $y = f(x)$?\nThis was one of the primary motivations for the development of Integral Calculus.\n\n### 2. The Concept of Elementary Area\nConsider the region bounded by the curve $y = f(x)$, the x-axis, and the ordinates $x = a$ and $x = b$.\nWe can imagine this region divided into extremely thin vertical strips.\n\n**Vertical Strip Approach:**\n* Consider an arbitrary strip at position $x$ with infinitesimally small width $dx$.\n* The height of this strip is approximately $y = f(x)$.\n* The area of this rectangular strip is $dA = \\text{height} \\times \\text{width} = y \\cdot dx = f(x) dx$.\n* The total area $A$ is the sum of these elemental areas as $x$ varies from $a$ to $b$.\n\n$$ A = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx $$\n\n**Horizontal Strip Approach:**\nSometimes, it is easier to integrate with respect to $y$.\nConsider the region bounded by $x = g(y)$, the y-axis, and lines $y = c, y = d$.\n* Take a horizontal strip at height $y$ with width $dy$.\n* The length of this strip is $x = g(y)$.\n* Elemental Area $dA = x \\cdot dy = g(y) dy$.\n\n$$ A = \\int_{c}^{d} g(y) dy $$\n\n### 3. Sign Convention of Area\nThe definite integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$ represents the *algebraic* sum of areas.\n1.  **Above x-axis:** If $f(x) > 0$, the integral is positive.\n2.  **Below x-axis:** If $f(x) < 0$, the integral is negative. However, geometric **Area** is always positive.\n    * Formula: Area = $\\int_{a}^{b} |f(x)| dx$.\n3.  **Crossing the axis:** If the curve crosses the axis at $c \\in (a, b)$, we must split the integral:\n    $$ A = \\left| \\int_{a}^{c} f(x) dx \\right| + \\left| \\int_{c}^{b} f(x) dx \\right| $$",

In calculus, we often encounter equations involving an unknown **function** and its **derivatives** (rates of change). Such an equation is called a **Differential Equation (D.E.)**.\n\n**Definition:**\nAn equation involving an independent variable ($x$), a dependent variable ($y$), and derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable ($\\frac{dy}{dx}, \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}, \\dots$) is called an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE).\n\n* **Example:** $\\frac{dy}{dx} = x + 5$ (Slope depends on x).\n* **Physical Context:** Newton's Second Law $F = ma$ is actually $F = m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$.\n\n### 2. Order of a Differential Equation\nThe **Order** of a D.E. is the order of the **highest order derivative** appearing in the equation.\n* Example: $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y = 0$. Highest derivative is 2nd order. Order = 2.\n* Example: $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^3 - 4\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$. Highest derivative is 1st order. Order = 1.\n\n### 3. Degree of a Differential Equation\nThe **Degree** is the power (exponent) of the highest order derivative when the equation is expressed as a **polynomial in derivatives**.\n\n**Conditions for Degree to be Defined:**\n1.  Derivatives must not be inside transcendental functions like $\\sin(y'), e^{y'}, \\log(y')$.\n2.  The equation must be cleared of fractional powers (radicals) on derivatives.\n\n**Examples:**\n* $\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = 0$. Order: 2. Power of highest derivative: 1.

We want the LHS to look like the derivative of a product.\nMultiply the entire equation by a function $\\mu(x)$ (called Integrating Factor).\n$$ \\mu \\frac{dy}{dx} + \\mu P y = \\mu Q $$\nWe want LHS $= \\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu y) = \\mu \\frac{dy}{dx} + y \\frac{d\\mu}{dx}$.\nComparing terms, we need: $\\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\mu P$.\nSeparating variables: $\\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu} = P dx$.\nIntegrate: $\\ln \\mu = \\int P dx \\implies \\mu = e^{\\int P dx}$.\n\n**Integrating Factor:**\n$$ I.F. = e^{\\int P dx} $$\n\n**Solution:**\nMultiplying by I.F. makes the LHS a perfect derivative.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(y \\cdot I.F.) = Q \\cdot I.F. $$\nIntegrating both sides w.r.t $x$:\n$$ y(I.F.) = \\int (Q \\cdot I.F.) dx + C $$\n\n### 3. The Second Linear Form\nIf the equation is linear in $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dy} + P_1(y)x = Q_1(y) $$\n* **I.F.:** $e^{\\int P_1 dy}$\n* **Solution:** $x(I.F.) = \\int (Q_1 \\cdot I.F.) dy + C$\n\n### 4. Bernoulli's Equation (Reducible to Linear) - JEE Focus\nEquations of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + Py = Qy^n$.\n* Divide by $y^n$: $y^{-n}\\frac{dy}{dx} + P y^{1-n} = Q$.\n* Put $v = y^{1-n}$. Then $\\frac{dv}{dx} = (1-n)y^{-n}\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n* This transforms the equation into a standard linear form in $v$.",

Scalar vs Vector Quantities\nIn physics and mathematics, quantities are classified into two types:\n* **Scalars:** Quantities having only magnitude (e.g., Mass, Length, Time, Temperature, Work).\n* **Vectors:** Quantities having both magnitude and direction (e.g., Displacement, Velocity, Force, Acceleration).\n\n### 2. Representation of a Vector\nA vector is represented by a directed line segment. Let points $A$ and $B$ be the initial and terminal points.\n* **Notation:** $\\vec{AB}$ or $\\vec{a}$.\n* **Magnitude:** The length of the segment $AB$, denoted by $|\\vec{AB}|$ or $|\\vec{a}|$. Magnitude is always non-negative.\n* **Direction:** The direction from $A$ to $B$.\n\n### 3. Types of Vectors\n1.  **Zero Vector (Null Vector):** A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide.

The Optimization Problem\nIn business, engineering, and military operations, we often need to make decisions to maximize efficiency (like profit, speed, or output) or minimize waste (like cost, time, or risk), while adhering to specific limitations (budget, capacity, resources). These are called **Optimization Problems**.\n\n**Linear Programming (LP)** is a specific class of optimization problems where:\n1.  The function to be optimized is linear.\n2.  The constraints are linear inequalities.\n\n### 2. Key Terminology\nConsider a furniture dealer who sells tables and chairs. He wants to maximize profit.\n\n1.  **Decision Variables:** The unknown quantities to be determined. usually denoted by $x, y$. (e.g., $x=$ number of tables, $y=$ number of chairs).\n2.  **Objective Function ($Z$):** A linear function $Z = ax + by$ which needs to be maximized or minimized. (e.g., Total Profit $Z = 500x + 150y$).\n3.  **Constraints:** The linear inequalities or equations (restrictions) on the variables. (e.g., Investment limit, Space limit).\n    * Format: $a_1x + b_1y \\le d_1$, etc.\n4.  **Non-negative Constraints:** In physical problems, variables cannot be negative. $x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0$.\n\n### 3.

The Feasible Region\nThe **Feasible Region** is the common region determined by all the constraints (inequalities) including non-negative constraints. Every point in this region represents a **Feasible Solution**.\n* Points outside represent **Infeasible Solutions**.\n\n### 2. Convexity of the Region\nThe feasible region of an LPP is always a **Convex Polygon** (in 2D). This means if you take any two points inside the region, the line segment joining them lies entirely inside the region.\n\n### 3. The Corner Point Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of LP)\nThis theorem gives us the strategy to find the optimal solution without checking infinite points.\n\n**Theorem 1:** Let $R$ be the feasible region (convex polygon) for an LPP and let $Z = ax + by$ be the objective function. When $Z$ has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), it **must occur at one of the corner points (vertices)** of the feasible region.\n\n**Theorem 2 (Existence):**\nLet $R$ be the feasible region.\n* If $R$ is **Bounded**, then the objective function $Z$ has both a Maximum and a Minimum value on $R$, and each occurs at a corner point.\n* If $R$ is **Unbounded**, then a Maximum or Minimum value **may or may not exist**. If it exists, it must occur at a corner point.\n\n### 4. Algorithm (Corner Point Method)\n1.  Formulate the LPP.\n2.  Draw the graph of constraints and identify the Feasible Region.\n3.

This is called **Conditional Probability**.\n\n**Definition:**\nLet $E$ and $F$ be two events associated with the same sample space $S$. The conditional probability of the event $E$ given that $F$ has occurred (denoted by $P(E|F)$) is given by:\n$$ P(E|F) = \\frac{P(E \\cap F)}{P(F)}, \\quad \\text{provided } P(F) \\neq 0 $$\n\n**Intuitive Interpretation (Sample Space Reduction):**\nWhen we know $F$ has occurred, the sample space $S$ is no longer relevant. The \"new\" sample space is $F$. We are looking for the portion of $E$ that lies *inside* $F$, which is $E \\cap F$. Thus, the probability is the ratio of the size (or probability) of $E \\cap F$ to the size of $F$.\n\n### 2.

Bayes' Theorem\nIf we observe event $A$, what is the probability that it was caused by $E_i$?\n$$ P(E_i|A) = \\frac{P(E_i \\cap A)}{P(A)} = \\frac{P(E_i) P(A|E_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(E_j) P(A|E_j)} $$\n\n* **Prior Probability:** $P(E_i)$ (Initial belief).\n* **Posterior Probability:** $P(E_i|A)$ (Updated belief after evidence $A$).\n* **Likelihood:** $P(A|E_i)$.",
