In rigorous geometry, it is defined as a **Locus**.\n\n**Definition:** The collection of all points in a plane, which are at a fixed distance from a fixed point in the plane, is called a circle.\n* **Centre:** The fixed point.\n* **Radius:** The fixed distance.\n\n#### 1.1 The Plane Partition\nA circle divides the plane on which it lies into three distinct parts:\n1.  **Interior:** The set of points whose distance from the centre is *less* than the radius ($d < r$).\n2.  **The Circle (Boundary):** The set of points whose distance is *equal* to the radius ($d = r$).\n3.  **Exterior:** The set of points whose distance is *greater* than the radius ($d > r$).\n\n*Note:* The \"Circular Region\" consists of the Circle + Interior.\n\n#### 1.2 Chord and Diameter\n* **Chord:** A line segment connecting any two points on the circle.\n* **Diameter:** A chord passing through the centre. It is the **longest chord** of the circle.\n    * *Proof of Longest Chord:* In any $\\Delta AOB$ formed by centre $O$ and chord $AB$, sum of two sides ($OA+OB = 2r$) > third side ($AB$). Thus $AB < 2r$, unless $A, O, B$ are collinear (diameter), where $AB = 2r$.\n\n#### 1.3 Arcs: Minor, Major, and Semi-Circle\nA piece of a circle between two points is called an **Arc**.\n* If the arc is smaller than half the perimeter, it is a **Minor Arc**.\n* If it is larger, it is a **Major Arc**.\n* If the ends of the arc are ends of a diameter, it is a **Semi-Circle**.\n\n#### 1.4 Sectors and Segments (Crucial Distinction)\nStudents often confuse these two.\n* **Segment:** The region between a **Chord** and an **Arc**.\n    * *Major Segment:* Contains the centre.\n    * *Minor Segment:* Does not contain the centre.\n* **Sector:** The region between an **Arc** and the two **Radii** joining the centre to the endpoints of the arc.\n    * *Analogy:* A Sector is like a \"Pizza Slice\". A Segment is like the \"Crust\" cut off by a straight knife.",

Chords $AB$ and $CD$ such that $AB = CD$.\n**To Prove:** $\\angle AOB = \\angle COD$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  In $\\Delta AOB$ and $\\Delta COD$:\n    * $OA = OC$ (Radii of same circle)\n    * $OB = OD$ (Radii of same circle)\n    * $AB = CD$ (Given)\n2.  By **SSS Congruence Rule**, $\\Delta AOB \\cong \\Delta COD$.\n3.  By CPCT, $\\angle AOB = \\angle COD$.\n\n#### Theorem 9.2 (Converse)\n**Statement:** If the angles subtended by the chords of a circle at the centre are equal, then the chords are equal.\n**Proof:** Use **SAS Congruence** (Radius-Angle-Radius).\n\n#### Theorem 9.3 (Perpendicular from Centre)\n**Statement:** The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.\n**Given:** Circle with centre $O$, chord $AB$, and $OM \\perp AB$.\n**To Prove:** $AM = MB$.\n**Proof:**\n1.  In right-angled $\\Delta OMA$ and $\\Delta OMB$:\n    * $OA = OB$ (Hypotenuse, Radii)\n    * $OM = OM$ (Common Side)\n    * $\\angle OMA = \\angle OMB = 90^\\circ$ (Given)\n2.  By **RHS Congruence Rule**, $\\Delta OMA \\cong \\Delta OMB$.\n3.  By CPCT, $AM = MB$.\n\n**Intuition:** If you fold the circle along the perpendicular $OM$, point $A$ will land exactly on point $B$ due to symmetry.\n\n#### Theorem 9.4 (Converse of Perpendicular)\n**Statement:** The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord.\n**Proof:** Use **SSS Congruence** ($OA=OB, AM=MB, OM=OM$).\n\n#### Theorem 9.5 (Three Points Circle)\n**Statement:** There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear points.\n**Logic:** The perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $BC$ intersect at a unique point $O$ (circumcentre).
