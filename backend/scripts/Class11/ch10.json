      "content": "### 1. Geometric Construction\nThe term \"Conic Section\" is derived from the fact that these curves are obtained by taking sections (slices) of a cone.\n\n**The Double-Napped Right Circular Cone:**\nConsider a fixed vertical line $l$ (Axis) and another line $m$ (Generator) intersecting it at a fixed point $V$ (Vertex) making an angle $\\alpha$ ($0 < \\alpha < 90^\\circ$).\nWhen the line $m$ rotates around $l$ maintaining the constant angle $\\alpha$, it generates a surface called a **Double-Napped Right Circular Cone**.\n* **Nappes:** The vertex $V$ separates the cone into two parts: the Upper Nappe and the Lower Nappe.\n\n### 2. Intersection with a Plane\nLet a plane intersect the cone. The curve of intersection depends on the position of the plane relative to the vertex and the axis.\nLet $\\beta$ be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical axis of the cone.\n\n#### Case 1: Plane passes through Vertex (Degenerate Conics)\nIf the plane cuts through the vertex $V$, the section is not a curve but a geometric entity:\n1.  **Point:** If $\\beta = 90^\\circ$ (Plane perpendicular to axis). Intersection is just $V$.\n2.  **Line:** If $\\beta = \\alpha$ (Plane touches the generator). Intersection is a line.\n3.  **Pair of Intersecting Lines:** If $0 \\le \\beta < \\alpha$ (Plane cuts through both nappes). Intersection is two lines crossing at $V$.\n\n#### Case 2: Plane does NOT pass through Vertex (Non-Degenerate Conics)\n1.  **Circle:** If $\\beta = 90^\\circ$. The plane is perpendicular to the axis. The section is a circle.\n2.  **Ellipse:** If $\\alpha < \\beta < 90^\\circ$. The plane cuts obliquely across one nappe.\n3.  **Parabola:** If $\\beta = \\alpha$. The plane is parallel to a generator. It cuts one nappe but never closes.\n4.  **Hyperbola:** If $0 \\le \\beta < \\alpha$. The plane intersects both nappes. The curve has two disjoint branches.\n\n### 3. Analytic Definition (Locus Definition)\nA conic section is the locus of a point $P$ which moves in a plane such that the ratio of its distance from a fixed point (Focus) to its perpendicular distance from a fixed line (Directrix) is a constant.\n* This constant ratio is called **Eccentricity ($e$)**.\n    * If $e = 0$: Circle (Special case of ellipse).\n    * If $e = 1$: Parabola.\n    * If $0 < e < 1$: Ellipse.\n    * If $e > 1$: Hyperbola."

Equation of a Circle\nLet $P(x, y)$ be any point on the circle with center $C(h, k)$ and radius $r$.\nBy the distance formula, $CP = r$.\n$$ \\sqrt{(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2} = r $$\nSquaring both sides gives the **Standard Equation**:\n$$ (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 $$\n\n### 3.
