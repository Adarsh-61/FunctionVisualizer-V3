      "content": "### 1. The Art of Counting\nCounting seems trivial—we learn it as toddlers ($1, 2, 3...$). However, the counting required in mathematics and computer science is **Enumerative Combinatorics**: determining the number of ways a complex event can occur without actually listing every possibility.\n\n**Real-Life Examples:**\n* How many distinct passwords can be created using 8 characters?\n* How many ways can a cricket team of 11 be selected from 15 players?\n* How many paths exist from point A to B in a grid?\n\nListing these is impossible. We need **logic**.\n\n### 2. The Fundamental Principle of Counting (FPC)\nThe FPC consists of two core rules: Multiplication and Addition.\n\n#### A. The Multiplication Principle (AND Rule)\nIf an event can occur in $m$ different ways, and following which another event can occur in $n$ different ways, then the total number of occurrences of the events in the given order is $m \\times n$.\n\n**Logic:**\nImagine a tree diagram. You have $m$ branches for the first choice. From *each* of those $m$ branches, $n$ new branches sprout. Total tips = $m \\times n$.\n\n**Example:**\n* 3 distinct shirts and 2 distinct pants.\n* Choice 1 (Shirt): 3 options.\n* Choice 2 (Pant): 2 options.\n* Total Outfits = $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\n#### B. The Addition Principle (OR Rule)\nIf an event can be performed in $m$ ways and another independent event can be performed in $n$ ways, and both cannot occur simultaneously (mutually exclusive), then the total ways to perform **either** of them is $m + n$.\n\n**Example:**\n* You want to travel from Delhi to Mumbai.\n* Options: 3 Flights **OR** 2 Trains.\n* You cannot take both. Total options = $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 3. Common Logical Pitfalls\n* **Overcounting:** Counting the same arrangement twice (e.g., counting $(A, B)$ and $(B, A)$ as different when order doesn't matter).\n* **Undercounting:** Missing specific cases (usually edge cases like zero).\n* **Double Counting:** In \"At least one\" problems, adding overlapping sets without subtracting the intersection (Inclusion-Exclusion).\n\n**Crucial Decision:**\n* Do the tasks happen one after another? $\\to$ **MULTIPLY**\n* Do the tasks happen as alternative choices? $\\to$ **ADD**",

Definition\nTo simplify the product of decreasing natural numbers (like $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$), we define the **Factorial**.\n\nThe factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.\n\n$$ n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times ... \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 $$\n\n### 2.
