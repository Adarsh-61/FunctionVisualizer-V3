In Class IX, you learned the definition of a polynomial in one variable. Now, we will explore their deeper properties, geometric behaviors, and the hidden relationships between their roots and coefficients.\n\n#### 1.1 What is a Polynomial?\nA polynomial $p(x)$ in one variable $x$ is an algebraic expression of the form:\n$$p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$$\nwhere:\n* $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are constants (real numbers) called **coefficients**.\n* $a_n \\neq 0$ (Leading coefficient).\n* $n$ is a **non-negative integer** (Whole Number) called the **Degree** of the polynomial.\n\n**Crucial Distinction:** Expressions like $\\sqrt{x}+2$, $\\frac{1}{x-1}$, or $x^{3/2}$ are **NOT** polynomials because the exponent of the variable is not a whole number[cite: 278].\n\n#### 1.2 Classification by Degree\nThe **degree** dictates the behavior of the polynomial.\n1.  **Linear Polynomial (Degree 1):**\n    * Form: $ax + b, \\quad a \\neq 0$.\n    * Examples: $2x - 3$, $\\sqrt{3}x + 5$[cite: 280].\n    * Graph: A straight line.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Polynomial (Degree 2):**\n    * Form: $ax^2 + bx + c, \\quad a \\neq 0$.\n    * Origin: 'Quadrate' means square [cite: 283].\n    * Examples: $2x^2 + 3x - \\frac{2}{5}$, $y^2 - 2$ [cite: 283-285].\n    * Graph: A Parabola.\n\n3.  **Cubic Polynomial (Degree 3):**\n    * Form: $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, \\quad a \\neq 0$ [cite: 295].\n    * Examples: $x^3$, $\\sqrt{2}x^3$, $3x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1$ [cite: 293].\n\n#### 1.3 Value vs. Zero of a Polynomial\nIt is vital to distinguish between the *value* of a function and its *zero*.\n* **Value at $k$:** If we replace $x$ with a real number $k$ in $p(x)$, the result $p(k)$ is the value.\n    * *Example:* For $p(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4$, value at $x=2$ is $p(2) = 2^2 - 3(2) - 4 = -6$[cite: 297].\n* **Zero of Polynomial:** A real number $k$ is a **zero** if and only if $p(k) = 0$.\n    * *Example:* $p(-1) = (-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0$. Thus, $-1$ is a zero [cite: 300-303].",

Geometrically, finding a zero is equivalent to finding where a curve touches the ground (the x-axis).\n\n#### 2.1 Linear Polynomials ($ax + b$)\nThe graph of $y = ax + b$ is always a **straight line** [cite: 320].\n* It intersects the x-axis at exactly one point.\n* The coordinate of intersection is $(-\\frac{b}{a}, 0)$.\n* Thus, a linear polynomial has exactly **one** zero [cite: 339].\n\n#### 2.2 Quadratic Polynomials ($ax^2 + bx + c$)\nThe graph of a quadratic polynomial is a curve called a **Parabola**[cite: 361].\n* **Shape:** If $a > 0$, it opens **upwards** ($\\cup$). If $a < 0$, it opens **downwards** ($\\cap$) [cite: 352-361].\n* **Intersection with X-axis:** The x-coordinates of the intersection points are the zeroes.\n\n**Three Cases of Intersection:**\n1.  **Two Distinct Points:** The graph cuts the x-axis at two separate points $A$ and $A'$.\n    * Result: **2 distinct zeroes** [cite: 377-379].\n    * Algebraic condition: Discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac > 0$.\n2.  **One Point (Touching):** The graph touches the x-axis at exactly one point $A$ (the vertex).\n    * Result: **2 equal zeroes** (appears as 1 unique zero) [cite: 384-390].\n    * Algebraic condition: $D = 0$.\n3.  **No Intersection:** The graph is entirely above or below the x-axis.\n    * Result: **No real zeroes** [cite: 395-403].\n    * Algebraic condition: $D < 0$.\n\n**Conclusion:** A quadratic polynomial has **at most** 2 real zeroes [cite: 405].\n\n#### 2.3 Cubic Polynomials ($ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$)\nThe graph of a cubic polynomial is a curve that can bend twice.\n* It can cross the x-axis at 1, 2, or 3 points.\n* **Example:** $y = x^3 - 4x$ cuts the axis at -2, 0, and 2. Hence, 3 zeroes [cite: 413].\n* **Example:** $y = x^3$ cuts only at 0. Hence, 1 zero [cite: 437].\n* **Conclusion:** A polynomial of degree $n$ has **at most** $n$ zeroes[cite: 444].",
