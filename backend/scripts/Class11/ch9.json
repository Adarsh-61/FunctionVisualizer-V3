      "content": "### 1. The Marriage of Algebra and Geometry\nGeometry, as studied by Euclid, was purely visual and logical. Algebra, on the other hand, deals with numbers and equations. **René Descartes (1596-1650)** revolutionized mathematics by combining these two fields into **Coordinate Geometry** (or Analytical Geometry).\n\nThe core idea is simple yet profound: **A point in a plane is a pair of numbers $(x, y)$, and a curve in a plane is an equation $f(x, y) = 0$.**\n\n### 2. Recap of Earlier Concepts\nBefore diving into lines, let us rigorously recall the tools from Class 10.\n\n#### A. Distance Formula\nThe distance $d$ between two points $P(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2)$ is derived from the Pythagoras Theorem:\n$$ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} $$\n* **Note:** Distance is always non-negative.\n* **Properties:** $PQ = 0 \\iff P = Q$.\n\n#### B. Section Formula\nThe coordinates of a point $P(x, y)$ dividing the line segment joining $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ internally in the ratio $m:n$ are:\n$$ x = \\frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \\quad y = \\frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n} $$\n* **Midpoint Formula:** If $m:n = 1:1$, then $P = (\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$.\n* **External Division:** If the ratio is $m:n$ externally, replace '$+$' with '$-$'. (Important for JEE).\n\n#### C. Area of a Triangle\nFor a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)$:\n$$ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| $$\n* If Area = 0, the three points are **collinear** (lie on a straight line).\n* This determinant form is crucial for understanding linear dependence.\n\n### 3. Locus of a Point\nA **Locus** is the path traced by a point moving under specific geometric conditions. The equation of a straight line is essentially the locus of a point moving in a constant direction.",

It is the most fundamental concept in Calculus and Coordinate Geometry.\n\n**Inclination ($\\theta$):**\nThe angle $\\theta$ that a line makes with the **positive direction of the x-axis**, measured in the **anticlockwise** sense.\n* Range of $\\theta$: $0^\\circ \\le \\theta < 180^\\circ$.\n* Horizontal line: $\\theta = 0^\\circ$.\n* Vertical line: $\\theta = 90^\\circ$.\n\n**Slope ($m$):**\nIf $\\theta \\neq 90^\\circ$, the slope $m$ is defined as the tangent of the inclination.\n$$ m = \\tan \\theta $$\n\n* If $\\theta$ is acute ($<90^\\circ$), $m > 0$ (Line rises to the right).\n* If $\\theta$ is obtuse ($>90^\\circ$), $m < 0$ (Line falls to the right).\n* If $\\theta = 0^\\circ$, $m = 0$.\n* If $\\theta = 90^\\circ$, $m$ is **undefined**.\n\n### 2. Slope Given Two Points\nLet a line pass through $P(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2)$.\nDraw perpendiculars to the axes to form a right triangle.\nThe vertical rise is $y_2 - y_1$.\nThe horizontal run is $x_2 - x_1$.\nFrom trigonometry:\n$$ \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Adjacent}} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\nThus,\n$$ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\n\n### 3. Conditions for Parallelism and Perpendicularity\nLet two non-vertical lines have slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n**A. Parallel Lines ($l_1 || l_2$):**\nTheir inclinations are equal: $\\alpha = \\beta$.\n$$ \\tan \\alpha = \\tan \\beta \\implies m_1 = m_2 $$\n\n**B.
