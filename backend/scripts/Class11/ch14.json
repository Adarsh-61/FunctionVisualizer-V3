      "content": "### 1. The Nature of Probability\nIn earlier classes, we studied probability as a measure of chance based on empirical observations (Statistics approach) or classical definitions (number of favorable outcomes / total outcomes). In Class 11, we formalize this using **Set Theory**. This is known as the **Axiomatic Approach to Probability**.\n\n### 2. Random Experiment\nAn experiment is called a **Random Experiment** if it satisfies two conditions:\n1.  It has more than one possible outcome.\n2.  It is not possible to predict the outcome in advance.\n\n**Examples:**\n* **Tossing a fair coin:** Outcomes are Head (H) or Tail (T). We cannot predict which one will occur.\n* **Rolling a die:** Outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n* *Counter-Example:* Tossing a stone in the air. We know it will fall down. This is a deterministic experiment, not random.\n\n### 3. Outcomes and Sample Space\n* **Outcome:** A possible result of a random experiment.\n* **Sample Space ($S$):** The set of *all* possible outcomes of a random experiment. Each element of the sample space is called a **sample point**.\n\n**Deriving Sample Spaces:**\n1.  **Two Coins:** Tossing two coins (or one coin twice).\n    $S = \\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$.\n    $n(S) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n2.  **Two Dice:** Rolling two dice.\n    $S = \\{(1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,6), (2,1), ..., (6,6)\\}$.\n    $n(S) = 6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n3.  **Coin and Die:** Tossing a coin; if Head, roll a die.\n    $S = \\{T, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6\\}$.\n    Note: Sample spaces need not have \"symmetric\" looking elements.\n\n4.  **Drawing Cards:** From a deck of 52.\n    $n(S) = 52$.\n    *Suits:* Spades ($\\spadesuit$), Clubs ($\\clubsuit$) [Black]; Hearts ($\\heartsuit$), Diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$) [Red].\n    *Ranks:* 2, 3, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A.",

      "content": "### 1. Definition of an Event\nAn **Event** is defined as any **subset** of the sample space $S$.\nIf the outcome of the experiment is an element of subset $E$, we say that the event $E$ has occurred.\n\n* **Example:** Rolling a die. $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n    Event $A$: \"Getting an odd number\" $\\implies A = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$.\n    Since $A \\subset S$, $A$ is an event.\n\n### 2. Types of Events\n1.  **Impossible Event:** The empty set $\\phi$. It contains no sample points.\n    * *Ex:* Rolling a 7 on a standard die.\n2.  **Sure Event:** The whole sample space $S$. It always happens.\n    * *Ex:* Rolling a number less than 7 on a die.\n3.  **Simple (Elementary) Event:** An event containing only **one** sample point.\n    * *Ex:* Getting a Head and a 5 ($H5$) in the coin-die experiment.\n4.  **Compound Event:** An event containing more than one sample point.\n\n### 3. Algebra of Events (Set Theory Connection)\nSince events are sets, we can apply set operations:\n\n* **Complementary Event (Not A):** Denoted by $A'$ or $\\bar{A}$.\n    $A' = S - A$. The event occurs if $A$ does *not* occur.\n\n* **Event A or B ($A \\cup B$):** The event that either $A$ occurs or $B$ occurs (or both).\n    $A \\cup B = \\{ \\omega : \\omega \\in A \\text{ or } \\omega \\in B \\}$.\n\n* **Event A and B ($A \\cap B$):** The event that both $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously.\n    $A \\cap B = \\{ \\omega : \\omega \\in A \\text{ and } \\omega \\in B \\}$.\n\n* **Event A but not B ($A - B$):** $A \\cap B'$.\n\n### 4. Mutually Exclusive and Exhaustive Events\n\n**Mutually Exclusive (Disjoint):**\nTwo events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.\n$$ A \\cap B = \\phi $$\n* *Ex:* Getting an even number and getting an odd number on a die.\n\n**Exhaustive Events:**\nA set of events $E_1, E_2, ..., E_n$ is exhaustive if their union is the entire sample space.\n$$ E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup ... \\cup E_n = S $$\n* *Ex:* $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{4, 5, 6\\}$ are mutually exclusive AND exhaustive for a die roll.",

The axiomatic approach, proposed by **A.N. Kolmogorov**, defines probability as a function satisfying specific rules.\n\n### 2. The Definition\nLet $S$ be the sample space of a random experiment.
