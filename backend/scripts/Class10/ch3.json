          "content": "### 1. The Power of Two\nIn Class IX, we studied linear equations in *one* variable (e.g., $2x + 5 = 0$), which represents a point on a number line. We also introduced linear equations in *two* variables (e.g., $ax + by + c = 0$), which represents a **straight line** in the Euclidean plane. [cite: 363-366]\n\nNow, we step into the world of **Systems**. Real-world problems rarely depend on a single constraint. Usually, multiple conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.\n* **Example:** \"The number of rides Akhila had is half the number of times she played Hoopla,\" AND \"Total cost was ₹20.\" [cite: 367-370].\n\nThese two conditions form a **Pair of Linear Equations**. Finding a solution means finding a state of the world that satisfies *both* conditions at the same time.\n\n#### 1.1 Mathematical Definition\nA pair of linear equations in two variables $x$ and $y$ is generally of the form:\n$$a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0$$\n$$a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0$$\nwhere $a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2, b_2, c_2$ are real numbers, and $a_1^2 + b_1^2 \\neq 0$, $a_2^2 + b_2^2 \\neq 0$.\n\n#### 1.2 The Geometric Interpretation\nSince every linear equation represents a line, a pair of equations represents **two lines** on the same Cartesian plane. There are only three logical possibilities for two lines in a plane:\n\n1.  **Intersecting Lines:** The lines cross at exactly one unique point. This point is the **Unique Solution**. The system is **Consistent**.\n2.  **Parallel Lines:** The lines never meet. There is **No Solution**. The system is **Inconsistent**.\n3.  **Coincident Lines:** The lines lie exactly on top of each other. Every point on the line is a solution. There are **Infinitely Many Solutions**. The system is **Dependent (and Consistent)**. [cite: 364-365]\n\nThis geometric intuition is the foundation of Linear Algebra. The question \"Does a solution exist?\" is equivalent to \"Do the lines meet?\"",
