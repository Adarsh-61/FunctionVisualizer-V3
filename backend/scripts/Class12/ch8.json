      "content": "### 1. Introduction: The Area Problem\nIn geometry, we have formulas for the area of regular shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles). But how do we find the area of an irregular shape bounded by a curve $y = f(x)$?\nThis was one of the primary motivations for the development of Integral Calculus.\n\n### 2. The Concept of Elementary Area\nConsider the region bounded by the curve $y = f(x)$, the x-axis, and the ordinates $x = a$ and $x = b$.\nWe can imagine this region divided into extremely thin vertical strips.\n\n**Vertical Strip Approach:**\n* Consider an arbitrary strip at position $x$ with infinitesimally small width $dx$.\n* The height of this strip is approximately $y = f(x)$.\n* The area of this rectangular strip is $dA = \\text{height} \\times \\text{width} = y \\cdot dx = f(x) dx$.\n* The total area $A$ is the sum of these elemental areas as $x$ varies from $a$ to $b$.\n\n$$ A = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx $$\n\n**Horizontal Strip Approach:**\nSometimes, it is easier to integrate with respect to $y$.\nConsider the region bounded by $x = g(y)$, the y-axis, and lines $y = c, y = d$.\n* Take a horizontal strip at height $y$ with width $dy$.\n* The length of this strip is $x = g(y)$.\n* Elemental Area $dA = x \\cdot dy = g(y) dy$.\n\n$$ A = \\int_{c}^{d} g(y) dy $$\n\n### 3. Sign Convention of Area\nThe definite integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$ represents the *algebraic* sum of areas.\n1.  **Above x-axis:** If $f(x) > 0$, the integral is positive.\n2.  **Below x-axis:** If $f(x) < 0$, the integral is negative. However, geometric **Area** is always positive.\n    * Formula: Area = $\\int_{a}^{b} |f(x)| dx$.\n3.  **Crossing the axis:** If the curve crosses the axis at $c \\in (a, b)$, we must split the integral:\n    $$ A = \\left| \\int_{a}^{c} f(x) dx \\right| + \\left| \\int_{c}^{b} f(x) dx \\right| $$",
