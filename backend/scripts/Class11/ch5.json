      "content": "### 1. From Equations to Inequalities\nIn earlier classes, we solved equations like $2x + 3 = 0$ to find a specific value. However, real-world problems often involve **constraints** rather than equalities.\n* *\"Budget is at most \u20b9200\"* $\\implies x \\le 200$\n* *\"Speed must exceed 60 km/h\"* $\\implies s > 60$\n* *\"Marks required to pass\"* $\\implies m \\ge 33$\n\n**Definition:**\nTwo real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbols $<$, $>$, $\\le$, or $\\ge$ form an **Inequality**.\n\n### 2. Classification of Inequalities\n\n**A. Numerical vs Literal**\n* **Numerical:** $3 < 5$, $7 > 2$. (Fixed truth)\n* **Literal:** $x < 5$, $y \\ge 2$. (Depends on variable)\n\n**B. Strict vs Slack**\n* **Strict Inequality:** Uses $<$ or $>$. The boundary is **excluded**.\n    * Example: $x < 3$ means $x$ can be 2.999... but never 3.\n* **Slack Inequality:** Uses $\\le$ or $\\ge$. The boundary is **included**.\n    * Example: $x \\le 3$ means $x$ can be exactly 3.\n\n**C. Linear vs Quadratic**\n* **Linear Inequality:** The variable has power 1. (e.g., $ax + b < 0$, $ax + by < c$)\n* **Quadratic Inequality:** The variable has power 2. (e.g., $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$)\n\n*Note: This chapter focuses on Linear Inequalities in one and two variables.*\n\n### 3. Algebraic Properties (The Rules of the Game)\nSolving an inequality is similar to solving an equation, with one **critical exception**.\n\n**Rule 1: Addition/Subtraction**\nEqual numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an inequality without affecting the sign.\n* If $a < b$, then $a + k < b + k$.\n* *Intuition:* Shifting two points on a number line by the same distance preserves their relative order.\n\n**Rule 2: Multiplication/Division by Positive Number**\nBoth sides can be multiplied (or divided) by the same **positive** number without changing the sign.\n* If $a < b$ and $k > 0$, then $ka < kb$.\n\n**Rule 3: Multiplication/Division by Negative Number (CRITICAL)**\nWhen both sides are multiplied (or divided) by a **negative** number, the inequality sign **MUST BE REVERSED**.\n* If $a < b$ and $k < 0$, then $ka > kb$.\n\n**Why? (Proof by Logic)**\nConsider $2 < 5$.\nMultiply by $-1$.\n* LHS becomes $-2$.\n* RHS becomes $-5$.\nOn the number line, $-5$ is to the left of $-2$. Therefore, $-2 > -5$.\nThe order flips across the origin.",
